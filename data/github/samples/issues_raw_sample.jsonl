I have been using Bitcoin for a couple of days, and while many users will not care about the details, I want to know (at least during my initial testing of the system) exactly how it works. This will help me, and other tech-savvy users understand the security implications.\n\nTo me, the biggest \"black box\" of the whole system is the wallet. It's a binary blob which I am told to keep backed up or else. It's unclear to me how I would restore it without erasing recent transactions. I'm not sure which data is stored in it and which is not -- from the look of some other bugs here, it seems to store more data than just the public/private keys (such as config data). Does it store the names I have associated with the addresses? (I wouldn't want to lose my PC, restore my wallet.dat, and discover I can't tell who sent me what, so I'd hope it does store those names.) Does it store sending addresses? (I don't think it should, as that's more of an address book than a crucial wallet.) And it isn't encrypted with a password.\n\nI'm not asking for answers to these questions -- I can find them out if I really want to. I'm saying that these answers should be immediately obvious from inspecting the wallet file. There should be nothing \"magical\" about this file, for an advanced user.\n\nI would like to see a transition to a \"Wallet 2.0\" file format, which is simply a PGP-encrypted text file (so, binary, but a simple gpg -d will get the text out). I should be able to encrypt it with either a symmetric or public key.\n\nInside the file, there would be a simple ASCII format, such as:\n&lt;address&gt; (active|inactive) [name] &lt;pub-key&gt; &lt;priv-key&gt;\n\nwith one address per line (or split into \"sections\" if the pub-key and priv-key are too long to put on a single line). The active|inactive determines whether the address shows up as a receive address in the GUI (so when it pre-generates 100 addresses, they all show up here, and are all marked inactive until the user presses \"New Address\" in the UI).\n\nThis would only contain receiving addresses. Sending addresses would be in a separate address book file, which would hopefully also be a text file, and I could back up too if I wanted to but isn't critical.\n\nNow, at a glance, I (as a technical user) can tell exactly what data is stored in the wallet.

You said it was \"optional\" but that sort of implies that your software will possibly be looking for an address and available BTC. It should not, since the format should allow arbitrary machine-ignored text after the #. So your exporter should write # [address] [available BTC] or whatever you want, but your importer should completely ignore everything after the comment and just use the privatekey to derive the public key and address.\n\nAlso note, if you haven't written the code for this already, that I already implemented, in C using OpenSSL, the code to take a 32-byte private key and generate the full 279-byte DER key (which Bitcoin internally calls the \"private key\") and 65-byte public key.

I am a developer, but would like to shed light on what I encountered when discovering the world of Bit Coins.\n\nAfter reading a taste of what BCs were I download the client (developer side) and fired it up (OSX). I was met with a string of characters not too frightening for a developer and especially not when expecting crazy encryption fun times to be going on. However, I didn't quite know what I was looking at or what it meant to me. I stumbled onto Bit Faucet and it introduced the notion that these characters were an address used to receive BC. So I learned something. At some point I clicked \"New...\" and my string of characters changed; this befuddled me a bit. Some more reading calmed me as it was \"good practice\" to generate these new addresses and use them liberally.\n\nAs I continued to learn about what I had gotten myself into it came to light that the client I had downloaded was the key to whatever BTC I began to acquire. So as a developer, my first questions were, \"where is the secret key?\", \"how do I protect it?\", and \"how do I move it and still use this client?\". All of these questions are being touched on in IRC and in this thread. So I'm glad to see the discussion is taking place. However, I have yet to see reasonable discourse that talks about what sort of experience our target end-user should see. When starting a conversion in IRC #bitcoin-dev about the above questions I quickly received answers such as: \"just backup your wallet.dat file\", \"use truecrypt\", \"use gpg\", \"use a USB stick or dropbox\", et cetera. My response is... DUH! The point of the discourse was not to get an answer I am perfectly capable of doing _as a developer_. It was to discuss how to make Bit Coins and the associated software accessible to our girlfriends, mothers, and fathers. So, with all of that context, and as a development brother looking at my experience as a first time user (while it is still fresh, I discovered BC two days ago and now have 40BTC, yay), I'd like to suggest the following:\n- Do NOT generate the secret magic sauce upon the client first loading, instead, provide an introduction screen that says, \"Hey, welcome to the world of Bit Coins! Let's walk through a few concepts before you get started\". Introduce the high-level concepts of: 1) you will be creating a wallet, 2) you generate \"addresses\" which others use to send you Bit Coins 3) your wallet is the key to accessing your Bit Coins, if you create another wallet on a different device, you will have two different \"accounts\" (like at a different bank)\n- Prompt the user to create a wallet, have the default directory available, but at least introduce them to where this super sensitive information is. Then show a generating magic sauce message with a repeated explanation that THIS IS IMPORTANT\n- I personally suggest _integrating_ TrueCrypt as a sub-system of the BC client. Use a true crypt volumes to store either just the sensitive files or everything (good when using a portable USB key). Prompt the user to enter a passphrase so the true crypt volume can be created and used. People are used to passwords, opening the BC client and being prompted for a password by default won't alarm anyone.\n- True Crypt has done work to be used on portable devices. I recommend Bit Coin do the same and be completely runnable via a USB stick.\n- Provide a GUI level option to \"backup your wallet\" (ie. make a copy of the true crypt volume somewhere else). It would also be handy to be able to name your wallets and prominently display it in the client. When backing up the name would default to \"Wallet Backup 2011-02-16\" and the wallet would be marked as a backup. If a client opens a backup wallet, a warning could be issued stating as much and asking if this should now be considered a primary wallet (in the event of a restore)\n\nMy suggestions focus on education and features crucial to the adoption of Bit Coins, in my opinion. I cannot feel good about telling a non-techy about Bit Coins without these features. I want to be able to tell my girlfriend and her be able to make sense of the experience on her own. Thanks for all of the hard work thus far and I'm really enjoying my foray into the Bit Coins community.\n\nCheers,\n", "author": "benlake", "created_at": "2011-05-03T05:40:00+00:00"}, {"body": "If TryCrypt give anything?

I'd be satisfied with commerce systems including a business rule which says \"if you want further notifications, attach an email address to your order\". The spam problem is already addressed broadly in the email domain, and email addresses can be rather anonymous.\n\nSigning an email with the bitcoin key is a neat idea, but there's a lack of symmetry in the typical commerce application. Customer learns a bitcoin address for vendor, so vendor can later sign messages back to customer using that address's private key. Not so in the reverse, unless the customer provides an address of their own as part of the exchange.\n\nWhat I would like to see is the ability to attach a small, optional data field to a transaction. For example, here in Slovakia, the banking system provides for the attachment of several fields to an electronic payment: constant symbol (4), variable symbol (10), specific symbol (16?), note (32?). The constant symbol is used for tax accounting purposes, and the rest are used to correlate payments with accounts, similar to \"please be sure to include your account/invoice number on your check\".\n\nI'm guessing this is already provided for in the protocol, though I'm not familiar with that part of the implementation.
