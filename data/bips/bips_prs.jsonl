For blind signing, the nonce and challenge are blinded so the delegator returns a blind Schnorr signature that the counterparty unblinds; thanks to Schnorr\u2019s linearity, the same tweak is incorporated without revealing the final message or linkable details (optionally with predicate proofs for policy).\r\n\r\nThis enables participants like collaborative custodians to co\u2011sign when needed, while avoiding the broad visibility that comes with holding an xpub.\r\n\r\nMore background and discussions can be found: https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/chain-code-delegation-private-access-control-for-bitcoin-keys/1837. \r\n\r\nThis is joint work with @jesseposner.

{"number": 1964, "title": "Caution on tweaking in bip 327", "body": "The BIP is quite difficult to parse in terms of understanding the functionality and safety of tweaking keys.\r\n\r\nIn particular, while it is a terrible idea for more than one reason, constructing a MuSig2 aggregated key using related (bip32 unhardened) individual keys in the list is very specifically insecure, but that is not noted.\r\n\r\nIt's admittedly debatable whether you ever have to specify that a certain kind of stupid behaviour is to be warned against, but my justification is:\r\n\r\n1. The BIP is very explicitly \"supporting tweaking\" right from the Abstract. It isn't immediately clear that this means tweaking the ouput, not the input. Perhaps a minor note early on would help with that.\r\n\r\n2. Pre- this patch, in the section I'm editing, the document again explicitly says it supports tweaking, and this time, in relation to the *input* keys. It then goes on to explain the background of the attack outlined on the mailing list (I updated to a gnusha link: https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/576db60c-b05b-5b9a-75e5-9610f3e04eda@gmail.com/ ), which is much more \"in scope\" in the sense that the honest signer behaviour isn't stupid, but at the same time, the conditions of that attack are quite obscure.\r\n\r\n3. While the behaviour is stupid, it's not inconceivable, and it sits within perhaps the most likely/common usage pattern of MuSig2: multisig for better cold storage/savings security. Multiple keys controlled by the same signer, using multiple hardware devices for redundant security. As noted by Jonas Nick in an earlier email convo we had, there is at least one reason such stupid behaviour might be considered: less backup (and/or laziness). I admit that a large majority would have the common sense to not reuse the same wallet seed across devices, but in case anyone did it, they are exposed in a specific way that is very unobvious.\r\n\r\n4. To generalize the above, for me the BIP is not sufficiently explicit that the design of the MuSig2 algorithm does not address the possibility of related input keys at all (and it would be easy as an engineer consumer to assume that related keys would be safe, if they didn't look at the mathematical formulas too much).\r\n\r\nIf you want a concrete description of the attack, here you go (see Appendix A.2 of [DahLIAS](https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/692) for what I mean by \"multipliers:\"):\r\n\r\n2 devices set up with one secret key each, where the keys are on the same branch so that sk1 = sk2 + t for \"public\" t (handwave).\r\n\r\nThe network is compromised by the attacker. It exchanges messages with device 1 (sk1); receives nonces, maliciously calculates the response nonces (with the multipliers), receives a partial sig for sk1 and can complete the signing protocol just from knowing t.\r\n\r\nThe higher-level idea here is (I'm cribbing from an earlier email I wrote):\r\n\r\n> ... which I think nicely illustrates something that occurred to me earlier: there's a question of \"what is authorization?\" being raised here. In a single key signature, there is a single authorizing event, so we never worry too much about the \"semantics\" of the action of signing. It's one action, and it's all or nothing: you authorize, or you don't.\r\n\r\n> In multi-signing it's not atomic. The semantics of individual signing events are something decided on by the operator(s) of the protocol. I might want to say \"I authorize if and only if 3 different hardware devices sign\" (or 3 people or whatever). How does the security definition represent this? I believe the rationale for applying EUF-CMA as in the paper is \"we take a maximally pessimistic approach and assume that all except honest are the adversary, then we demand the adversary produce a signature without authorizing events from the honest signer\" on the basis that, if the honest signer did authorize, then there is no security failure (the honest signer wanted it!) - but that's exactly the point I'm questioning.\r\n\r\n> So it's back to the slightly confusion position of \"that this is possible is worrying, but all the obvious ways of exploiting it as a weakness reduce to an already fundamentally insecure multisig setup (using calculable tweaks of existing keys), and the base security model does not include this\" (\"capture\", perhaps).\r\n\r\n> Whimsically I wonder if this can be seen as analogous to EUF style security vs SUF style security: for most purposes you don't need strong unforgeability but it can cause implementation headaches if you don't have it (MtGox,  hehe).", "state": "open", "created_at": "2025-09-11T13:25:01+00:00", "merged_at": null, "closed_at": null, "author": "AdamISZ", "merged": false, "mergeable": null, "comments_count": 6, "review_comments_count": 2}

QES2 presents a transitional solution that enhances security during the shift towards quantum-safe systems.\r\n\r\nSpecification: The BIP outlines the structure, key generation, signing, and verification methods for the hybrid scheme.\r\n\r\nRationale: The hybrid approach ensures that if one signature method is compromised, the other still provides protection, offering a balanced trade-off between security and backward compatibility.\r\n\r\nReference Implementation: A reference implementation will be linked later for further review and testing.", "state": "open", "created_at": "2025-04-18T08:03:18+00:00", "merged_at": null, "closed_at": null, "author": "j1729labs", "merged": false, "mergeable": null, "comments_count": 16, "review_comments_count": 20}

The key components of this implementation are:\r\n\r\nZero-Collar Options: The ability to create options that are not dependent on the underlying asset's price, which can be used to stabilize the value of stablecoins.\r\n\r\nLightning Network Integration: Leveraging the Lightning Network's decentralized, trustless, and efficient architecture to create a system for stabilizing the value of stablecoins.\r\n\r\nSmart Contract Implementation: A new type of smart contract that utilizes the Lightning Network and zero-collar options to achieve value stabilization for stablecoins.\r\n\r\nMotivation\r\n\r\nStablecoins play a crucial role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, providing a stable store of value and facilitating transactions. However, maintaining the stability of stablecoin values remains a challenge. This implementation aims to address this issue by introducing a novel approach that combines the benefits of the Lightning Network and zero-collar options.\r\n\r\nImplementation Details\r\n\r\nThe implementation involves creating a new type of smart contract that leverages the Lightning Network to enable the creation of zero-collar options for stablecoins. This smart contract will allow users to:\r\n\r\nCreate zero-collar options for stablecoins, specifying the strike price and expiration date. Trade these options on the Lightning Network, providing liquidity and price discovery. Exercise the options upon expiration, receiving the difference between the strike price and the current stablecoin price. The smart contract will be designed to be decentralized, trustless, and efficient, ensuring the stability of stablecoin values while maintaining the benefits of the Lightning Network.\r\n\r\nBenefits\r\n\r\nStablecoin Value Stabilization: This implementation provides a robust mechanism for stabilizing the value of stablecoins, reducing volatility and increasing their utility as a medium of exchange and store of value.\r\n\r\nDecentralization and Trust: By leveraging the Lightning Network and smart contracts, this solution maintains a decentralized and trustless architecture, ensuring the integrity and reliability of the value stabilization process.\r\n\r\nEfficiency and Scalability: The Lightning Network's off-chain transaction capabilities enable efficient and scalable processing of zero-collar options, reducing transaction costs and improving overall performance.\r\n\r\nEcosystem Integration: This implementation can be seamlessly integrated into the existing cryptocurrency ecosystem, providing a valuable tool for stablecoin issuers, traders, and users.\r\n\r\nFuture Enhancements\r\n\r\nAutomated Market Making: Implementing an automated market making mechanism to provide continuous liquidity and price discovery for zero-collar options.\r\n\r\nCross-Chain Compatibility: Exploring the possibility of extending the zero-collar options to other blockchain networks, enabling cross-chain value stabilization for stablecoins.\r\n\r\nUser Interface and Developer Tools: Developing user-friendly interfaces and developer tools to simplify the creation, trading, and management of zero-collar options on the Lightning Network.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nThis pull request introduces a groundbreaking solution for stabilizing the value of stablecoins using zero-collar options on the Lightning Network. By leveraging the decentralized, trustless, and efficient architecture of the Lightning Network, this implementation provides a robust and scalable mechanism for maintaining the stability of stablecoin values.

This isn't a backwards-incompatible change any more than switching to a new address format is, so doesn't impact existing BIP 21 implementations in a new way, however provides a nice conclusion to the query-parameter-based upgrade path - once a form of payment instructions has broad adoption, senders can simply drop the existing address field, keeping their existing query parameter encoding, rather than replace the existing address field.

The current BIP text states to only compare the first 12 bytes instead of 16. This is in theory a semantics change, but wouldn't be observable except with negligible probability (v2 nodes that use 12 vs 16 can communicate with each other, and each can communicate with v1). However, there are possible future extensions that could make this observable (specifically, see footnote 19), so it seems worthwhile to still switch to 16.\r\n* Related to the previous point, it is also possible to detect incoming v1 connections of the wrong network: if the network magic does not match, but the version message type string after it does. Without this, an incoming connection from a v1 peer will get sent key + garbage, which in turn will almost certainly cause them to disconnect immediately, and changing this should not make much of a difference, but it allows for faster disconnect in this situation.\r\n* Drop the BIP330 message types from the short encodings list in the BIP.

Taproot Assets enable\r\nthe representation of arbitrary (normal and collectibles) assets on top of\r\nBitcoin without bloating the base chain. The protocol is designed such that\r\ntransactions interacting with Taproot Assets are indistinguishable from\r\nregular transactions from the PoV of the Bitcoin blockchain. Taproot Assets\r\nextend the base Taproot script tree with a nested ''asset script'' tree (a\r\nmerkle-sum sparse merkle tree, or MS-SMT) that commits to valid witnesses as\r\nstructured metadata that allow for proofs of the movement of assets across\r\nthe transaction graph.  The provenance of transfers of a Taproot Asset can\r\nbe verified using a hermetic proof transmitted as flat file, or using the\r\naide of an externally maintained Universe, which is a MS-SMT that indexes\r\non-chain asset issuance+transfers, which natively supports\r\nproof-of-reserves/supply system.\r\n\r\nTaproot Assets support off-chain single and multi-hop transfers over\r\nLightning channels (based on the BOLT protocol suite), with the latter\r\nmanifested using Taproot Assets' unique embedded asset script system.  Light\r\nclient verification of on-chain Taproot Asset transfers is facilitated by a\r\nseries of on and off-chain merkle proofs, which can be compressed by\r\ndelegating a trust relationship to an active Universe instance. A variant on\r\noff-chain multi-party channels are proposed to support off-chain transfer of\r\nnormal assets.

Main intention is to generate very strong passwords for sensitive applications like encrypting of ssh keys, master password for password managers etc. Passwords are constrained by length. Min. 20 character and max. 86 character. Generated passwords have at least 120 and maximum of 516 bits of entropy. This is provably overkill for applications like Gmail or twitter but is not the intended use case anyway.\r\n\r\nPasswords are generated by encoding whole 64 bytes of  generated entropy and removing any spaces or new lines inserted by Base64 encoding process. Slice base64 result string\r\non index 0 to `pwd_len`. This slice is the resulting password. As `pwd_len` is limited to 86, passwords will not contain padding.\r\n\r\nBase64 is a great and well known candidate for password use case as it contains both lower/upper case characters, numbers and special characters `+` and `/`.\r\n\r\n## Constraints\r\n* `pwd_length` min. 20 max. 86\r\n\r\n## Changes:\r\n* fix typo in XPRV\r\n* fix formatting in other implementations\r\n* new application = passwords\r\n\r\n## Implementations:\r\n* already implemented in [btc-hd-wallet](https://github.com/scgbckbone/btc-hd-wallet)\r\n* opened [PR](https://github.com/ethankosakovsky/bip85/pull/16) in reference implementation\r\n* opened [PR](https://github.com/Coldcard/firmware/pull/127) to Coldcard firmware (merged in https://github.com/Coldcard/firmware/commit/26986cfc852116922d36708cbc3ea63d6f883aa4)\r\n\r\n", "state": "closed", "created_at": "2022-07-11T14:26:51+00:00", "merged_at": "2023-06-29T18:04:23+00:00", "closed_at": "2023-06-29T18:04:23+00:00", "author": "scgbckbone", "merged": true, "mergeable": null, "comments_count": 24, "review_comments_count": 1}

Any PSBT software supporting unknown data gently keeps our proprietary information and our proprietary software retrieves that data from serialized PSBT with no problem. There is no need for a PSBT implementation to provide explicit support for proprietary and proof-of-reserves types.\r\n\r\nMy last conclusion is reinforced by the evidence of all PSBT implementations I know of, including bitcoin core and HWI, not implementing proprietary and proof-of-reserve types. There is a high probability that part of BIP174 would be just ignored.", "state": "closed", "created_at": "2020-11-16T23:32:06+00:00", "merged_at": null, "closed_at": "2020-11-17T01:32:58+00:00", "author": "fametrano", "merged": false, "mergeable": null, "comments_count": 7, "review_comments_count": 0}

I think that having this as a formal standard will be a benefit to the Bitcoin-related software and hardware ecosystem. I hope that submitting this as PR will bring more discussion and comments.\r\n\r\nThere are three implementations, including two reference implementations: in C and in Python (that is also compatible with micropython to be suitable for embedded applications).

This potentially gives very little warning of an upgrade.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if it is desirable to reduce the timeoutheight for a bip8 deployment (for example from X to Y, Y < X), then activation via lockinontimeout at the shorter height would not result in consistent consensus rules. In particular, implementations  would see:\r\n\r\n * timeoutheight=Y, lockinontimeout=true: height Y-2016: STARTED, height Y: LOCKED_IN, height Y+2016: ACTIVE\r\n * timeoutheight=Y, lockinontimeout=false: height Y-2016: STARTED, height Y: FAILING, height Y+2016: ACTIVE\r\n * timeoutheight=X, lockinontimeout=*: height Y-2016: STARTED, height Y: STARTED, height Y+2016: LOCKED_IN, height Y+4032: ACTIVE\r\n\r\nThis patch also reduces the number of blocks that must signal during the new MUST_SIGNAL phase from the current 100% requirement to the same requirement as needed to trigger from STARTED to LOCKED_IN; this ensures that provided the same threshold is used, if the deployment transitions to LOCKED_IN at height X for any bip8 deployment, it will transition to LOCKED_IN at height X for every bip8 deployment, given the same startheight and timeoutheight > X.\r\n\r\nIt also uses the MUST_SIGNAL state to trigger validation rules checking blocks signal.

E.g., if a release was scheduled today to have started at today + 3 months, and finish at today + 1 year & 3 months, under this change it would be safe to make started today and finish at today + 1 year (& 3 months, perhaps?) with an earliestheight of today + 3 months.

One of the advantages of using compact size integers for key types was that the code to decode them in the implementations that work with PSBT. \r\n\r\nThe problem is, the code that decodes compact size integers, at least in BitcoinCore, limits the upper range of compact size integer to MAX_SIZE = 0x2000000 (see ` ReadCompactSize()` in serialize.h`).  Other implementations might implement the same restrictions, to improve the chances to catch incorrect data.\r\n\r\nI think it should be discussed how this issue can be solved.\r\n\r\nIt can be said that implementations should allow full range representable by compact integer (up to 2**64-1), and then some implementations will need to update their code, to have separate decoding function or add extra parameter to existing decoding function to be able to decode full-range compact size integers and retain the range check where it is needed.\r\n\r\nOr we can say that the range from 0 to 0x2000000 is enough for any key type or subtype, but then this should be spelled out in the BIP.

I may create a new BIP to cover the usage of this data for wallets to implement a whitelist for output verification.\r\n\r\nHere is the description of the imagined use case:\r\n\r\n1. Securely verify the xpub of the warm / hot wallet.\r\n2. Using the airgap signing tool, sign the xpub with all cold keys.\r\n3. Upload the signature/xpub pairs to the online unsigned transaction\r\ngenerator.\r\n4. Include one keyval pair per coldkey/xpub pairing.\r\n5. When offline signing, if the wallet detects there is a global keyval\r\nXPUB_SIGNATURE with its pubkey in the key, it must verify that all outputs\r\nhave BIP32_DERIVATION and that it can verify the outputs through the\r\nderivation, to the xpub, and to the signature.\r\n\r\nThe 0x01 global xpub entry allows HW wallet to verify change outputs.\r\n\r\nThis 0x02 global xpub signature will allow HW wallet to \"verify\" a whitelisted xpub that it has previously signed. Which is useful if HW wallets create some way for users to exchange xpubs securely. Instead of having to do the secure exchange every time, they would only need to do it once, then refer to the whitelist signature.\r\n\r\nI was thinking of adding some extra data for a label which would also be signed, that way Trezor could say \"Are you sure you want to pay Cindy?\" instead of address verification.\r\n\r\nReducing address reuse is a two pronged motion of encouraging change address rotation (0x01) and encouraging people use new addresses every time (0x02 facilitates features that remove some friction)\r\n\r\nAny comments are welcome.\r\n\r\nThanks.", "state": "closed", "created_at": "2019-07-10T06:34:02+00:00", "merged_at": null, "closed_at": "2024-04-24T16:02:14+00:00", "author": "junderw", "merged": false, "mergeable": false, "comments_count": 20, "review_comments_count": 1}

Say, I2P addresses to Tor? I'm not sure. Especially for networks that have no exit nodes as there is no overlap with the globally routed internet at all.\r\n\r\n* Lower precision of <code>time</code> field? seconds precision seems overkill, and can even be harmful, there have been attacks that exploited high precision timestamps for mapping the current network topology.\r\n\r\n  * (gmaxwell) If you care about space time field could be reduced to 16 bits easily.  Turn it into a \"time ago seen\" quantized to 1 hour precision. (IIRC we quantize times to 2hrs regardless).\r\n\r\n* Rolling <code>port</code> into <code>addr</code>, or making the port optional, would make it possible to shave off two bytes for address types that don't have ports (however, all of the currently listed formats have a concept of port.). It could also be an optional data item (see below).\r\n\r\n* (gmaxwell) Optional (per-service) data could be useful for various things:\r\n\r\n  * Node-flavors for striping (signalling which slice of the blocks the node has in selective pruning)\r\n\r\n  * Payload for is alternative ports for other transports (e.g. UDP ports)\r\n\r\n  * If we want optional flags. I guess the best thing would just be a byte to include the count of them, then a byte \"type\" for each one where the type also encodes if the payload is 0/8/16/32 bits.

I've implemented this new logic in `lnd` (as we're the primary user of this new functionality), and the changes were rather contained, so it shouldn't be a big change application logic wise.\r\n   * The extended filter has been removed as there isn't really a _clear_ use case for them atm, and they increase the index size for a full node.\r\n   * The gcs parameters have been re-parameterized, to set the fp rate independently from the modulus used when hashing the set of `N` items down to a single range.

Test vectors will be added once the BIP has been reviewed by the community and the reference implementation is updated.\r\n\r\n### Abstract\r\n\r\nThis BIP describes a new light client protocol in Bitcoin that improves upon currently available options. The standard light client protocol in use today, defined in BIP 37, has known flaws that weaken the security and privacy of clients and allow denial-of-service attack vectors on full nodes. The new protocol overcomes these issues by allowing light clients to obtain compact probabilistic filters of block content from full nodes and download full blocks if the filter matches relevant data.\r\n\r\nNew P2P messages empower light clients to securely sync the blockchain without relying on a trusted source. This BIP also defines a filter header, which serves as a commitment to all filters for previous blocks and provides the ability to efficiently detect malicious or faulty peers serving invalid filters. The resulting protocol guarantees that light clients with at least one honest peer are able to identify the correct block filters.\r\n\r\n### State of Implementation\r\n\r\nWe've tested the implementation of both a [light client implementing this BIP](https://github.com/lightninglabs/neutrino), as well as the serving full-node on Bitcoin's testnet over the past several months. Additionally, this new operating mode also serves as the basis for our [light weight Lightning node](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/).

{"number": 426, "title": "BIP151: Clarifications on sequence numbers.", "body": "~~This clarifies that the ciphertext payload length is meant to update the AEAD as AAD. OpenSSH does this, but in a naive way, [as seen here](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/60c2c4ea5e1ad0ddfe8b2877b78ed5143be79c53/cipher-chachapoly.c#L93) (aadlen is 4 -- poly1305_auth is called on both size and payload).~~\n\n~~Although the payload length _is_ AAD, OpenSSH violates [both](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7539#section-2.8.1) [RFCs](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-agl-tls-chacha20poly1305-03#section-5) by not including the AAD length (or the ciphertext length) in the MAC before finalization. This change to the bip includes the size explicitly as AAD.~~\n\nUpdate: Nevermind the above change. I confused myself by reading the openssh code too much (AAD not necessary due to bip151's encrypted size).\n\nThis change also explicitly mentions sequence numbers are meant to be uint32's which are allowed to overflow. This is in keeping with [openssh behavior](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/286f5a77c3bfec1e8892ca268087ac885ac871bf/packet.c#L1315). I don't think having a 64bit sequence provides any benefit over a 32bit one for bip151's use case: we're guaranteed to have rekeyed by the time the seq number reaches uint32_max, so there's no danger in reusing a previous IV/sequence earlier.\n\nAlong with the sequence size, this PR shrinks IV size to 64 bits [a la openssh](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/master/chacha.c#L81) (we weren't using all 96 bits even with 64bit sequences).

These discussions have led to decisions to stop using SHA-1 in\nPKI certificates. Specifically [2]\n1. SHA-1 certificates will no longer be issued after the end of 2015.\n2. SHA-1 certificates issued earlier will no longer be accepted after\n   the end of 2016.\n\nAs the CA discussions indicate, it is not sufficient to pull SHA-1\nsupport from CAs.

{"number": 188, "title": "Dynamically Controlled Bitcoin Block Size Max Cap", "body": "<pre>\n  BIP: 1xx\n  Title: Dynamically Controlled Bitcoin Block Size Max Cap\n  Author: Upal Chakraborty <bitcoin@upalc.com>\n  Status: Draft\n  Type: Standards Track\n  Created: 2015-08-24\n</pre>\n\n\n==Abstract==\n\nThis BIP proposes replacing the fixed one megabyte maximum block size with a dynamically controlled maximum block size that may increase or decrease with difficulty change depending on various network factors. I have two proposals regarding this...\n\ni. Depending only on previous block size calculation.\n\nii. Depending on previous block size calculation and previous Tx fee collected by miners.\n\n==Motivation==\n\nWith increased adoption, transaction volume on bitcoin network is bound to grow. If the one megabyte max cap is not changed to a flexible one which changes itself with changing network demand, then adoption will hamper and bitcoin's growth may choke up. Following graph shows the change in average block size since inception...\n\nhttps://blockchain.info/charts/avg-block-size?timespan=all&showDataPoints=false&daysAverageString=1&show_header=true&scale=0&address=\n\n==Specification==\n\n===Proposal 1 : Depending only on previous block size calculation===\n\n  If more than 50% of block's size, found in the first 2000 of the last difficulty period, is more than 90% MaxBlockSize\n      Double MaxBlockSize\n  Else if more than 90% of block's size, found in the first 2000 of the last difficulty period, is less than 50% MaxBlockSize\n      Half MaxBlockSize\n  Else\n      Keep the same MaxBlockSize\n\n===Proposal 2 : Depending on previous block size calculation and previous Tx fee collected by miners===\n\n  TotalBlockSizeInLastButOneDifficulty = Sum of all Block size of first 2008 blocks in last 2 difficulty period\n  TotalBlockSizeInLastDifficulty = Sum of all Block size of second 2008 blocks in last 2 difficulty period (This actually includes 8 blocks from last but one difficulty)\n\n  TotalTxFeeInLastButOneDifficulty = Sum of all Tx fees of first 2008 blocks in last 2 difficulty period\n  TotalTxFeeInLastDifficulty = Sum of all Tx fees of second 2008 blocks in last 2 difficulty period (This actually includes 8 blocks from last but one difficulty)\n\n  If ( ( (Sum of first 4016 block size in last 2 difficulty period)/4016 > 50% MaxBlockSize) AND (TotalTxFeeInLastDifficulty > TotalTxFeeInLastButOneDifficulty) AND (TotalBlockSizeInLastDifficulty > TotalBlockSizeInLastButOneDifficulty) )\n      MaxBlockSize = TotalBlockSizeInLastDifficulty \\* MaxBlockSize / TotalBlockSizeInLastButOneDifficulty\n  Else If ( ( (Sum of first 4016 block size in last 2 difficulty period)/4016 < 50% MaxBlockSize) AND (TotalTxFeeInLastDifficulty < TotalTxFeeInLastButOneDifficulty) AND (TotalBlockSizeInLastDifficulty < TotalBlockSizeInLastButOneDifficulty) )\n      MaxBlockSize = TotalBlockSizeInLastDifficulty \\* MaxBlockSize / TotalBlockSizeInLastButOneDifficulty\n  Else\n      Keep the same MaxBlockSize\n\n==Rationale==\n\nThese two proposals have been derived after discussion on [https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1154536.0 BitcoinTalk] and [http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-August/010285.html bitcoin-dev mailing list]. The original idea and its evolution in the light of various arguements can be found [http://upalc.com/maxblocksize.php here].\n\n===Proposal 1 : Depending only on previous block size calculation===\n\nThis solution is derived directly from the indication of the problem. If transaction volume increases, then we will naturally see bigger blocks. On the contrary, if there are not enough transaction volume, but maximum block size is high, then only few blocks may sweep the mempool. Hence, if block size is itself taken into consideration, then maximum block size can most rationally be derived. Moreover, this solution not only increases, but also decreases the maximum block size, just like difficulty.\n\n===Proposal 2 : Depending on previous block size calculation and previous Tx fee collected by miners===\n\nThis solution takes care of stable mining subsidy. It will not increase maximum block size, if Tx fee collection is not increasing and thereby creating a Tx fee pressure on the market. On the other hand, though the block size max cap is dynamically controlled, it is very difficult to game by any party because the increase or decrease of block size max cap will take place in the same ratio of average block size increase or decrease.\n\n==Compatibility==\n\nThis is a hard-forking change to the Bitcoin protocol; anybody running code that fully validates blocks must upgrade before the activation time or they will risk rejecting a chain containing larger-than-one-megabyte blocks.\n\n==Other solutions considered==\n\n[http://gtf.org/garzik/bitcoin/BIP100-blocksizechangeproposal.pdf Making Decentralized Economic Policy] - by Jeff Garzik\n\n[https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1078521.0 Elastic block cap with rollover penalties] - by Meni Rosenfeld\n\n[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0101.mediawiki Increase maximum block size] - by Gavin Andresen\n\n[https://gist.github.com/sipa/c65665fc360ca7a176a6 Block size following technological growth] - by Pieter Wuille\n\n[https://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper.pdf The Bitcoin Lightning Network: Scalable Off-Chain Instant Payments] - by Joseph Poon & Thaddeus Dryja\n\n==Deployment==\n\nIf consensus is achieved, deployment can be made at a future block number at which difficulty will change.\n", "state": "closed", "created_at": "2015-09-03T23:41:08+00:00", "merged_at": null, "closed_at": "2015-09-04T12:16:01+00:00", "author": "UpalChakraborty", "merged": false, "mergeable": false, "comments_count": 6, "review_comments_count": 0}

It is possible to type 'a' instead of '\u00e1' or 'n' instead of '\u00f1', etc. while still being able to identify the word with the first 4 characteres. This means that, for example, 'ca\u00f1a' and 'canal' cannot be both in the wordlist.\n3. There are some combinations of letters that sound similar. There cannot be two words that only differenciate on those combinations of letters. For example, 'hola' and 'ola' cannot be both in the wordlist. 'quiosco' and 'kiosko' cannot be both in the wordlist.\n4. Only standard form of verbs (infinitive), nouns and adjetives are in the list. \n5. The more common words are preferred over less common words.\n6. Shorter, simpler, words are preferred over longer words. For example 'libro' is prefered over 'librer\u00eda'\n\nThere are more restrictions.
