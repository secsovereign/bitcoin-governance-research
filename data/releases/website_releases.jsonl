There are none of these.\n\n\nLow severity vulnerabilities fixed in 30.0. There are 5 of these.\n\n\nHow to Upgrade\nIf you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on macOS)\nor bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).\nUpgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\npossible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\nwallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\nCompatibility\nBitcoin Core is supported and tested on operating systems using the\nLinux Kernel 3.17+, macOS 13+, and Windows 10+. Bitcoin\nCore should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\nfrequently tested on them. It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\nunsupported systems.\nNotable changes\nPolicy\n\n\nThe maximum number of potentially executed legacy signature operations in a\nsingle standard transaction is now limited to 2500. Signature operations in all\nprevious output scripts, in all input scripts, as well as all P2SH redeem\nscripts (if there are any) are counted toward the limit. The new limit is\nassumed to not affect any known typically formed standard transactions. The\nchange was done to prepare for a possible BIP54 deployment in the future. (#32521)\n\n\n-datacarriersize is increased to 100,000 by default, which effectively uncaps\nthe limit (as the maximum transaction size limit will be hit first). It can be\noverridden with -datacarriersize=83 to revert to the limit enforced in previous\nversions. (#32406)\n\n\nMultiple data carrier (OP_RETURN) outputs in a transaction are now permitted for\nrelay and mining. The -datacarriersize limit applies to the aggregate size of\nthe scriptPubKeys across all such outputs in a transaction, not including the\nscriptPubKey size itself. (#32406)\n\n\nThe minimum block feerate (-blockmintxfee) has been changed to 0.001 satoshi per\nvB. It can still be changed using the configuration option. This option can be used\nby miners to set a minimum feerate on packages added to block templates. (#33106)\n\n\nThe default minimum relay feerate (-minrelaytxfee) and incremental relay feerate\n(-incrementalrelayfee) have been changed to 0.1 satoshis per vB. They can still\nbe changed using their respective configuration options, but it is recommended to\nchange both together if you decide to do so. (#33106)\nOther minimum feerates (e.g. the dust feerate, the minimum returned by the fee\nestimator, and all feerates used by the wallet) remain unchanged. The mempool minimum\nfeerate still changes in response to high volume.\nNote that unless these lower defaults are widely adopted across the network, transactions\ncreated with lower fee rates are not guaranteed to propagate or confirm. The wallet\nfeerates remain unchanged; -mintxfee must be changed before attempting to create\ntransactions with lower feerates using the wallet. (#33106)\n\n\nP2P and network changes\n\n\nOpportunistic 1-parent-1-child package relay has been improved to handle\nsituations when the child already has unconfirmed parent(s) in the mempool.\nThis means that 1p1c packages can be accepted and propagate, even if they are\nconnected to broader topologies: multi-parent-1-child (where only 1 parent\nrequires fee-bumping), grandparent-parent-child (where only parent requires\nfee-bumping) etc. (#31385)\n\n\nThe transaction orphanage, which holds transactions with missing inputs temporarily\nwhile the node attempts to fetch its parents, now has improved Denial of Service protections.\nPreviously, it enforced a maximum number of unique transactions (default 100,\nconfigurable using -maxorphantx). Now, its limits are as follows: the number of\nentries (unique by wtxid and peer), plus each unique transaction\u00e2\u0080\u0099s input count divided\nby 10, must not exceed 3,000. The total weight of unique transactions must not exceed\n404,000 Wu multiplied by the number of peers. (#31829)\n\n\nThe -maxorphantx option no longer has any effect, since the orphanage no longer\nlimits the number of unique transactions. Users should remove this configuration\noption if they were using it, as the setting will cause an error in future versions\nwhen it is no longer recognized. (#31829)\n\n\nNew bitcoin command\n\nA new bitcoin command line tool has been added to make features more discoverable\nand convenient to use. The bitcoin tool just calls other executables and does not\nimplement any functionality on its own. Specifically bitcoin node is a synonym for\nbitcoind, bitcoin gui is a synonym for bitcoin-qt, and bitcoin rpc is a synonym\nfor bitcoin-cli -named. Other commands and options can be listed with bitcoin help.\nThe new bitcoin command is an alternative to calling other commands directly, but it\ndoesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t replace them, and there are no plans to deprecate existing commands. (#31375)\n\nExternal Signing\n\nSupport for external signing on Windows has been re-enabled. (#29868)\n\nIPC Mining Interface\n\n\nThe new bitcoin command does support one new feature: an (experimental) IPC Mining\nInterface that allows the node to work with Stratum v2 or other mining client software,\nsee (#31098). When the node is started with bitcoin -m node -ipcbind=unix it will\nlisten on a unix socket for IPC client connections, allowing clients to request block\ntemplates and submit mined blocks. The -m option launches a new internal binary\n(bitcoin-node instead of bitcoind) and is currently required but will become optional\nin the future (with #33229).\n\n\nIPC connectivity introduces new dependencies (see multiprocess.md),\nwhich can be turned off with the -DENABLE_IPC=OFF build option if you do not intend\nto use IPC. (#31802)\n\n\nInstall changes\n\n\nThe test_bitcoin executable is now installed in libexec/ instead of bin/.\nIt can still be executed directly, or accessed through the new bitcoin command\nas bitcoin test. The libexec/ directory also contains new bitcoin-node and\nbitcoin-gui binaries which support IPC features and are called through the\nbitcoin tool. In source builds only, test_bitcoin-qt, bench_bitcoin, and\nbitcoin-chainstate are also now installed to libexec/ instead of bin/ and\ncan be accessed through the new bitcoin command. See bitcoin help output for\ndetails. (#31679)\n\n\nOn Windows, the installer no longer adds a \u00e2\u0080\u009c(64-bit)\u00e2\u0080\u009d suffix to entries in the\nStart Menu (#32132), and it now automatically removes obsolete artifacts during\nupgrades (#33422).\n\n\nIndexes\n\n\nThe implementation of coinstatsindex was changed to prevent an overflow bug that\ncould already be observed on the default Signet. The new version of the index will\nneed to be synced from scratch when starting the upgraded node for the first time.\nThe new version is stored in /indexes/coinstatsindex/ in contrast to the old version\nwhich was stored at /indexes/coinstats/. The old version of the index is not deleted\nby the upgraded node in case the user chooses to downgrade their node in the future.\nIf the user does not plan to downgrade it is safe for them to remove /indexes/coinstats/\nfrom their datadir. A future release of Bitcoin Core may remove the old version of the\nindex automatically. (#30469)\n\n\nLogging\n\n\nUnconditional logging to disk is now rate limited by giving each source location\na quota of 1MiB per hour. Unconditional logging is any logging with a log level\nhigher than debug, that is info, warning, and error. All logs will be\nprefixed with [*] if there is at least one source location that is currently\nbeing suppressed. (#32604)\n\n\nWhen -logsourcelocations is enabled, the log output now contains the entire\nfunction signature instead of just the function name. (#32604)\n\n\nUpdated RPCs\n\n\nThe -paytxfee startup option and the settxfee RPC are now deprecated and\nwill be removed in Bitcoin Core 31.0. They allowed the user to set a static fee\nrate for wallet transactions, which could potentially lead to overpaying or underpaying.\nUsers should instead rely on fee estimation or specify a fee rate per transaction\nusing the fee_rate argument in RPCs such as fundrawtransaction, sendtoaddress,\nsend, sendall, and sendmany. (#31278)\n\n\nAny RPC in which one of the parameters is a descriptor will throw an error\nif the provided descriptor contains a whitespace at the beginning or the end\nof the public key within a fragment - e.g. pk( KEY) or pk(KEY ). (#31603)\n\n\nThe submitpackage RPC, which allows submissions of child-with-parents\npackages, no longer requires that all unconfirmed parents be present. The\npackage may contain other in-mempool ancestors as well. (#31385)\n\n\nThe waitfornewblock RPC now takes an optional current_tip argument. It\nis also no longer hidden. (#30635)\n\n\nThe waitforblock and waitforblockheight RPCs are no longer hidden.  (#30635)\n\n\nThe psbtbumpfee and bumpfee RPCs allow a replacement under fullrbf and no\nlonger require BIP-125 signalling. (#31953)\n\n\nTransaction Script validation errors used to return the reason for the error\nprefixed by either mandatory-script-verify-flag-failed if it was a consensus\nerror, or non-mandatory-script-verify-flag (without \u00e2\u0080\u009c-failed\u00e2\u0080\u009d) if it was a\nstandardness error. This has been changed to block-script-verify-flag-failed\nand mempool-script-verify-flag-failed for all block and mempool errors\nrespectively. (#33183)\n\n\nThe getmininginfo RPC now returns \u00e2\u0080\u009cblockmintxfee\u00e2\u0080\u009d result specifying the value of\n-blockmintxfee configuration. (#33189)\n\n\nThe getmempoolinfo RPC now returns an additional \u00e2\u0080\u009cpermitbaremultisig\u00e2\u0080\u009d and\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cmaxdatacarriersize\u00e2\u0080\u009d field, reflecting the -permitbaremultisig and -datacarriersize\nconfig values. (#29954)\n\n\nChanges to wallet-related RPCs can be found in the Wallet section below.\nNew RPCs\n\nA new REST API endpoint (/rest/spenttxouts/BLOCKHASH) has been introduced for\nefficiently fetching spent transaction outputs using the block\u00e2\u0080\u0099s undo data (#32540).\n\nBuild System\nUpdated settings\n\n\nThe -maxmempool and -dbcache startup parameters are now capped on 32-bit systems\nto 500MB and 1GiB respectively. (#32530)\n\n\nThe -natpmp option is now set to 1 by default. This means nodes with -listen\nenabled (the default) but running behind a firewall, such as a local network router,\nwill be reachable if the firewall/router supports any of the PCP or NAT-PMP\nprotocols. (#33004)\n\n\nThe -upnp setting has now been fully removed. Use -natpmp instead. (#32500)\n\n\nPreviously, -proxy specified the proxy for all networks (except I2P which\nuses -i2psam) and only the Tor proxy could have been specified separately\nvia -onion. Now, the syntax of -proxy has been extended and it is possible\nto specify separately the proxy for IPv4, IPv6, Tor and CJDNS by appending =\nfollowed by the network name, for example -proxy=127.0.0.1:5555=ipv6\nconfigures a proxy only for IPv6. The -proxy option can be used multiple\ntimes to define different proxies for different networks, such as\n-proxy=127.0.0.1:4444=ipv4 -proxy=10.0.0.1:6666=ipv6. Later settings\noverride earlier ones for the same network; this can be used to remove an\nearlier all-networks proxy and use direct connections only for a given\nnetwork, for example -proxy=127.0.0.1:5555 -proxy=0=cjdns. (#32425)\n\n\nThe -blockmaxweight startup option has been updated to be debug-only.\nIt is still available to users, but now hidden from the default -help text\nand shown only in -help-debug (#32654).\n\n\nChanges to GUI or wallet related settings can be found in the GUI or Wallet section below.\nWallet\n\n\nBDB legacy wallets can no longer be created or loaded. They can be migrated\nto the new descriptor wallet format. Refer to the migratewallet RPC for more\ndetails.\n\n\nThe legacy wallet removal drops redundant options in the bitcoin-wallet tool,\nsuch as -withinternalbdb, -legacy, and -descriptors. Moreover, the\nlegacy-only RPCs addmultisigaddress, dumpprivkey, dumpwallet,\nimportaddress, importmulti, importprivkey, importpubkey,\nimportwallet, newkeypool, sethdseed, and upgradewallet, are removed.\n(#32944, #28710, #32438, #31250)\n\n\nSupport has been added for spending TRUC transactions received by the\nwallet, as well as creating TRUC transactions. The wallet ensures that\nTRUC policy rules are being met. The wallet will throw an error if the\nuser is trying to spend TRUC utxos with utxos of other versions.\nAdditionally, the wallet will treat unconfirmed TRUC sibling\ntransactions as mempool conflicts. The wallet will also ensure that\ntransactions spending TRUC utxos meet the required size restrictions. (#32896)\n\n\nSince descriptor wallets do not allow mixing watchonly and non-watchonly descriptors,\nthe include_watchonly option (and its variants in naming) are removed from all RPCs\nthat had it. (#32618)\n\n\nThe iswatchonly field is removed from any RPCs that returned it. (#32618)\n\n\nunloadwallet - Return RPC_INVALID_PARAMETER when both the RPC wallet endpoint\nand wallet_name parameters are unspecified. Previously the RPC failed with a JSON\nparsing error. (#32845)\n\n\ngetdescriptoractivity - Mark blockhashes and scanobjects arguments as required,\nso the user receives a clear help message when either is missing. As in unloadwallet,\npreviously the RPC failed with a JSON parsing error. (#32845)\n\n\ngetwalletinfo - Removes the fields balance, immature_balance and\nunconfirmed_balance. (#32721)\n\n\ngetunconfirmedbalance - Removes this RPC command. You can query the getbalances\nRPC and inspect the \"mine\" \"untrusted_pending\" entry within the JSON\nresponse. (#32721)\n\n\nThe following RPCs now contain a version parameter that allows\nthe user to create transactions of any standard version number (1-3):\n\ncreaterawtransaction\ncreatepsbt\nsend\nsendall\nwalletcreatefundedpsbt\n(#32896)\n\n\n\nGUI changes\n\n\nThe GUI has been migrated from Qt 5 to Qt 6. On Windows, dark mode is now supported.\nOn macOS, the Metal backend is now used. (#30997)\n\n\nA transaction\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fee bump is allowed under fullrbf and no longer requires\nBIP-125 signalling. (#31953)\n\n\nCustom column widths in the Transactions tab are reset as a side-effect of legacy\nwallet removal. (#32459)\n\n\nLow-level changes\n\nLogs now include which peer sent us a header. Additionally there are fewer\nredundant header log messages. A side-effect of this change is that for\nsome untypical cases new headers aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t logged anymore, e.g. a direct\nBLOCK message with a previously unknown header and submitheader RPC.

Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt</code> (on macOS)\nor <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoind</code>/<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin-qt</code> (on Linux).</p>\n<p>Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\npossible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\nwallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.</p>\n<h1 id=\"compatibility\">Compatibility</h1>\n<p>Bitcoin Core is supported and tested on operating systems using the\nLinux Kernel 3.17+, macOS 13+, and Windows 10+. Bitcoin\nCore should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\nfrequently tested on them. It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\nunsupported systems.</p>\n<h1 id=\"notable-changes\">Notable changes</h1>\n<h2 id=\"policy\">Policy</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The maximum number of potentially executed legacy signature operations in a\nsingle standard transaction is now limited to 2500. Signature operations in all\nprevious output scripts, in all input scripts, as well as all P2SH redeem\nscripts (if there are any) are counted toward the limit. The new limit is\nassumed to not affect any known typically formed standard transactions. The\nchange was done to prepare for a possible BIP54 deployment in the future. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32521\">#32521</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-datacarriersize</code> is increased to 100,000 by default, which effectively uncaps\nthe limit (as the maximum transaction size limit will be hit first). It can be\noverridden with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-datacarriersize=83</code> to revert to the limit enforced in previous\nversions. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32406\">#32406</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Multiple data carrier (OP_RETURN) outputs in a transaction are now permitted for\nrelay and mining. The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-datacarriersize</code> limit applies to the aggregate size of\nthe scriptPubKeys across all such outputs in a transaction, not including the\nscriptPubKey size itself. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32406\">#32406</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The minimum block feerate (<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-blockmintxfee</code>) has been changed to 0.001 satoshi per\nvB. It can still be changed using the configuration option. This option can be used\nby miners to set a minimum feerate on packages added to block templates. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33106\">#33106</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The default minimum relay feerate (<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-minrelaytxfee</code>) and incremental relay feerate\n(<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-incrementalrelayfee</code>) have been changed to 0.1 satoshis per vB. They can still\nbe changed using their respective configuration options, but it is recommended to\nchange both together if you decide to do so. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33106\">#33106</a>)</p>\n<p>Other minimum feerates (e.g. the dust feerate, the minimum returned by the fee\nestimator, and all feerates used by the wallet) remain unchanged. The mempool minimum\nfeerate still changes in response to high volume.</p>\n<p>Note that unless these lower defaults are widely adopted across the network, transactions\ncreated with lower fee rates are not guaranteed to propagate or confirm. The wallet\nfeerates remain unchanged; <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-mintxfee</code> must be changed before attempting to create\ntransactions with lower feerates using the wallet. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33106\">#33106</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"p2p-and-network-changes\">P2P and network changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Opportunistic 1-parent-1-child package relay has been improved to handle\nsituations when the child already has unconfirmed parent(s) in the mempool.\nThis means that 1p1c packages can be accepted and propagate, even if they are\nconnected to broader topologies: multi-parent-1-child (where only 1 parent\nrequires fee-bumping), grandparent-parent-child (where only parent requires\nfee-bumping) etc. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31385\">#31385</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The transaction orphanage, which holds transactions with missing inputs temporarily\nwhile the node attempts to fetch its parents, now has improved Denial of Service protections.\nPreviously, it enforced a maximum number of unique transactions (default 100,\nconfigurable using <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-maxorphantx</code>). Now, its limits are as follows: the number of\nentries (unique by wtxid and peer), plus each unique transaction\u00e2\u0080\u0099s input count divided\nby 10, must not exceed 3,000. The total weight of unique transactions must not exceed\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">404,000</code> Wu multiplied by the number of peers. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31829\">#31829</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-maxorphantx</code> option no longer has any effect, since the orphanage no longer\nlimits the number of unique transactions. Users should remove this configuration\noption if they were using it, as the setting will cause an error in future versions\nwhen it is no longer recognized. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31829\">#31829</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"new-bitcoin-command\">New <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin</code> command</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A new <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin</code> command line tool has been added to make features more discoverable\nand convenient to use. The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin</code> tool just calls other executables and does not\nimplement any functionality on its own. Specifically <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin node</code> is a synonym for\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoind</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin gui</code> is a synonym for <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin-qt</code>, and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin rpc</code> is a synonym\nfor <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin-cli -named</code>. Other commands and options can be listed with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin help</code>.\nThe new <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin</code> command is an alternative to calling other commands directly, but it\ndoesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t replace them, and there are no plans to deprecate existing commands. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31375\">#31375</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"external-signing\">External Signing</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Support for external signing on Windows has been re-enabled.

When the node is started with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin -m node -ipcbind=unix</code> it will\nlisten on a unix socket for IPC client connections, allowing clients to request block\ntemplates and submit mined blocks. The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-m</code> option launches a new internal binary\n(<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin-node</code> instead of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoind</code>) and is currently required but will become optional\nin the future (with <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33229\">#33229</a>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>IPC connectivity introduces new dependencies (see <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/multiprocess.md\">multiprocess.md</a>),\nwhich can be turned off with the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-DENABLE_IPC=OFF</code> build option if you do not intend\nto use IPC. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31802\">#31802</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"install-changes\">Install changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">test_bitcoin</code> executable is now installed in <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">libexec/</code> instead of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bin/</code>.\nIt can still be executed directly, or accessed through the new <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin</code> command\nas <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin test</code>. The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">libexec/</code> directory also contains new <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin-node</code> and\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin-gui</code> binaries which support IPC features and are called through the\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin</code> tool. In source builds only, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">test_bitcoin-qt</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bench_bitcoin</code>, and\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin-chainstate</code> are also now installed to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">libexec/</code> instead of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bin/</code> and\ncan be accessed through the new <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin</code> command. See <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin help</code> output for\ndetails. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31679\">#31679</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On Windows, the installer no longer adds a \u00e2\u0080\u009c(64-bit)\u00e2\u0080\u009d suffix to entries in the\nStart Menu (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32132\">#32132</a>), and it now automatically removes obsolete artifacts during\nupgrades (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33422\">#33422</a>).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"indexes\">Indexes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The implementation of coinstatsindex was changed to prevent an overflow bug that\ncould already be observed on the default Signet. The new version of the index will\nneed to be synced from scratch when starting the upgraded node for the first time.</p>\n<p>The new version is stored in <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">/indexes/coinstatsindex/</code> in contrast to the old version\nwhich was stored at <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">/indexes/coinstats/</code>. The old version of the index is not deleted\nby the upgraded node in case the user chooses to downgrade their node in the future.\nIf the user does not plan to downgrade it is safe for them to remove <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">/indexes/coinstats/</code>\nfrom their datadir. A future release of Bitcoin Core may remove the old version of the\nindex automatically. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30469\">#30469</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"logging\">Logging</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Unconditional logging to disk is now rate limited by giving each source location\na quota of 1MiB per hour. Unconditional logging is any logging with a log level\nhigher than debug, that is <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">info</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">warning</code>, and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">error</code>. All logs will be\nprefixed with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">[*]</code> if there is at least one source location that is currently\nbeing suppressed. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32604\">#32604</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-logsourcelocations</code> is enabled, the log output now contains the entire\nfunction signature instead of just the function name. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32604\">#32604</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"updated-rpcs\">Updated RPCs</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-paytxfee</code> startup option and the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">settxfee</code> RPC are now deprecated and\nwill be removed in Bitcoin Core 31.0. They allowed the user to set a static fee\nrate for wallet transactions, which could potentially lead to overpaying or underpaying.\nUsers should instead rely on fee estimation or specify a fee rate per transaction\nusing the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">fee_rate</code> argument in RPCs such as <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">fundrawtransaction</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">sendtoaddress</code>,\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">send</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">sendall</code>, and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">sendmany</code>.

(<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31603\">#31603</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">submitpackage</code> RPC, which allows submissions of child-with-parents\npackages, no longer requires that all unconfirmed parents be present. The\npackage may contain other in-mempool ancestors as well. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31385\">#31385</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">waitfornewblock</code> RPC now takes an optional <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">current_tip</code> argument.

(<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31953\">#31953</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Transaction Script validation errors used to return the reason for the error\nprefixed by either <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">mandatory-script-verify-flag-failed</code> if it was a consensus\nerror, or <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">non-mandatory-script-verify-flag</code> (without \u00e2\u0080\u009c-failed\u00e2\u0080\u009d) if it was a\nstandardness error. This has been changed to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">block-script-verify-flag-failed</code>\nand <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">mempool-script-verify-flag-failed</code> for all block and mempool errors\nrespectively. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33183\">#33183</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getmininginfo</code> RPC now returns \u00e2\u0080\u009cblockmintxfee\u00e2\u0080\u009d result specifying the value of\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-blockmintxfee</code> configuration.

Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on macOS)\nor bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).\nUpgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\npossible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\nwallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\nCompatibility\nBitcoin Core is supported and tested on operating systems using the\nLinux Kernel 3.17+, macOS 13+, and Windows 10+. Bitcoin\nCore should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\nfrequently tested on them. It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\nunsupported systems.\nNotable changes\nMempool Policy\n\n\nThe maximum number of potentially executed legacy signature operations in a\nsingle standard transaction is now limited to 2500. Signature operations in all\nprevious output scripts, in all input scripts, as well as all P2SH redeem\nscripts (if there are any) are counted toward the limit. The new limit is\nassumed to not affect any known typically formed standard transactions. The\nchange was done to prepare for a possible BIP54 deployment in the future.\n\n\n#32521 policy: make pathological transactions packed with legacy sigops non-standard\n\n\nThe minimum block feerate (-blockmintxfee) has been changed to 1 satoshi per kvB. It can still be changed using the\nconfiguration option.\n\nThe default minimum relay feerate (-minrelaytxfee) and incremental relay feerate (-incrementalrelayfee) have been\nchanged to 100 satoshis per kvB. They can still be changed using their respective configuration options, but it is\nrecommended to change both together if you decide to do so.\n    \nOther minimum feerates (e.g. the dust feerate, the minimum returned by the fee estimator, and all feerates used by\nthe wallet) remain unchanged. The mempool minimum feerate still changes in response to high volume.\nNote that unless these lower defaults are widely adopted across the network, transactions created with lower fee\nrates are not guaranteed to propagate or confirm. The wallet feerates remain unchanged; -mintxfee must be changed\nbefore attempting to create transactions with lower feerates using the wallet.\n\n\n#33106 policy: lower the default blockmintxfee, incrementalrelayfee, minrelaytxfee\n\nLogging\nUnconditional logging to disk is now rate limited by giving each source location\na quota of 1MiB per hour. Unconditional logging is any logging with a log level\nhigher than debug, that is info, warning, and error. All logs will be\nprefixed with [*] if there is at least one source location that is currently\nbeing suppressed. (#32604)\nWhen -logsourcelocations is enabled, the log output now contains the entire\nfunction signature instead of just the function name. (#32604)\nRPC\n\nThe dumptxoutset RPC now requires a type parameter to be specified. To maintain pre\nv29.0 behavior, use the latest parameter. Documenting this change was missed in the v29.0\nrelease notes. (#30808)\n\nUpdated Settings\n\n\nThe -maxmempool and -dbcache startup parameters are now capped on\n32-bit systems to 500MB and 1GiB respectively.\n\n\n#32530 node: cap -maxmempool and -dbcache values for 32-bit\n\n\nWallet\n\n#31757 wallet: fix crash on double block disconnection\n#32553 wallet: Fix logging of wallet version\n\nP2P\n\n#32826 p2p: add more bad ports\n\nTest\n\n#32069 test:

Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt</code> (on macOS)\nor <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoind</code>/<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin-qt</code> (on Linux).</p>\n<p>Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\npossible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\nwallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.</p>\n<h1 id=\"compatibility\">Compatibility</h1>\n<p>Bitcoin Core is supported and tested on operating systems using the\nLinux Kernel 3.17+, macOS 13+, and Windows 10+. Bitcoin\nCore should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\nfrequently tested on them. It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\nunsupported systems.</p>\n<h1 id=\"notable-changes\">Notable changes</h1>\n<h3 id=\"mempool-policy\">Mempool Policy</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The maximum number of potentially executed legacy signature operations in a\nsingle standard transaction is now limited to 2500. Signature operations in all\nprevious output scripts, in all input scripts, as well as all P2SH redeem\nscripts (if there are any) are counted toward the limit. The new limit is\nassumed to not affect any known typically formed standard transactions. The\nchange was done to prepare for a possible BIP54 deployment in the future.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32521\">#32521</a> policy: make pathological transactions packed with legacy sigops non-standard</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The minimum block feerate (<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-blockmintxfee</code>) has been changed to 1 satoshi per kvB. It can still be changed using the\nconfiguration option.</p>\n</li>\n<li>The default minimum relay feerate (<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-minrelaytxfee</code>) and incremental relay feerate (<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-incrementalrelayfee</code>) have been\nchanged to 100 satoshis per kvB. They can still be changed using their respective configuration options, but it is\nrecommended to change both together if you decide to do so.\n    <ul>\n<li>Other minimum feerates (e.g. the dust feerate, the minimum returned by the fee estimator, and all feerates used by\nthe wallet) remain unchanged. The mempool minimum feerate still changes in response to high volume.</li>\n<li>Note that unless these lower defaults are widely adopted across the network, transactions created with lower fee\nrates are not guaranteed to propagate or confirm. The wallet feerates remain unchanged; <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-mintxfee</code> must be changed\nbefore attempting to create transactions with lower feerates using the wallet.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33106\">#33106</a> policy: lower the default blockmintxfee, incrementalrelayfee, minrelaytxfee</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"logging\">Logging</h3>\n<p>Unconditional logging to disk is now rate limited by giving each source location\na quota of 1MiB per hour. Unconditional logging is any logging with a log level\nhigher than debug, that is <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">info</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">warning</code>, and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">error</code>. All logs will be\nprefixed with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">[*]</code> if there is at least one source location that is currently\nbeing suppressed. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32604\">#32604</a>)</p>\n<p>When <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-logsourcelocations</code> is enabled, the log output now contains the entire\nfunction signature instead of just the function name. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32604\">#32604</a>)</p>\n<h3 id=\"rpc\">RPC</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">dumptxoutset</code> RPC now requires a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">type</code> parameter to be specified. To maintain pre\nv29.0 behavior, use the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">latest</code> parameter. Documenting this change was missed in the v29.0\nrelease notes. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30808\">#30808</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"updated-settings\">Updated Settings</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-maxmempool</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-dbcache</code> startup parameters are now capped on\n32-bit systems to 500MB and 1GiB respectively.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32530\">#32530</a> node: cap -maxmempool and -dbcache values for 32-bit</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3

Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on macOS)\nor bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).\nUpgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\npossible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\nwallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\nCompatibility\nBitcoin Core is supported and tested on operating systems using the\nLinux Kernel 3.17+, macOS 13+, and Windows 10+. Bitcoin\nCore should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\nfrequently tested on them. It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\nunsupported systems.\nNotable changes\nP2P and Network Changes\n\n\nSupport for UPnP was dropped. If you want to open a port automatically, consider using the -natpmp\noption instead, which uses PCP or NAT-PMP depending on router support. (#31130)\n\n\nlibnatpmp was replaced with a built-in implementation of PCP and NAT-PMP (still enabled using the -natpmp option). This supports automatic IPv4 port forwarding as well as IPv6 pinholing. (#30043)\n\n\nWhen the -port configuration option is used, the default onion listening port will now\nbe derived to be that port + 1 instead of being set to a fixed value (8334 on mainnet).\nThis re-allows setups with multiple local nodes using different -port and not using -bind,\nwhich would lead to a startup failure in v28.0 due to a port collision.\nNote that a HiddenServicePort manually configured in torrc may need adjustment if used in\nconnection with the -port option.\nFor example, if you are using -port=5555 with a non-standard value and not using -bind=...=onion,\npreviously Bitcoin Core would listen for incoming Tor connections on 127.0.0.1:8334.\nNow it would listen on 127.0.0.1:5556 (-port plus one). If you configured the hidden service manually\nin torrc now you have to change it from HiddenServicePort 8333 127.0.0.1:8334 to HiddenServicePort 8333\n127.0.0.1:5556, or configure bitcoind with -bind=127.0.0.1:8334=onion to get the previous behavior.\n(#31223)\n\n\nUpon receiving an orphan transaction (an unconfirmed transaction that spends unknown inputs), the node will attempt to download missing parents from all peers who announced the orphan. This change may increase bandwidth usage but make orphan-handling more reliable. (#31397)\n\n\nMempool Policy and Mining Changes\n\n\nEphemeral dust is a new concept that allows a single\ndust output in a transaction, provided the transaction\nis zero fee. In order to spend any unconfirmed outputs\nfrom this transaction, the spender must also spend\nthis dust in addition to any other desired outputs.\nIn other words, this type of transaction\nshould be created in a transaction package where\nthe dust is both created and spent simultaneously. (#30239)\n\n\nDue to a bug, the default block reserved weight (4,000 WU) for fixed-size block header, transactions count, and coinbase transaction was reserved twice and could not be lowered. As a result the total reserved weight was always 8,000 WU, meaning that even when specifying a -blockmaxweight higher than the default (even to the max of 4,000,000 WU), the actual block size will never exceed 3,992,000 WU.\nThe fix consolidates the reservation into a single place and introduces a new startup option, -blockreservedweight which specifies the reserved weight directly. The default value of -blockreservedweight is set to 8,000 WU to ensure backward compatibility for users who relied on the previous behavior of -blockmaxweight.\nThe minimum value of -blockreservedweight is set to 2,000 WU. Users setting -blockreservedweight below the default should ensure that the total weight of their block header, transaction count, and coinbase transaction does not exceed the reduced value or they may risk mining an invalid block. (#31384)\n\n\nUpdated RPCs\n\n\nThe RPC testmempoolaccept response now includes a reject-details field in some cases,\nsimilar to the complete error messages returned by sendrawtransaction (#28121)\n\n\nDuplicate blocks submitted with submitblock will now persist their block data\neven if it was previously pruned. If pruning is activated, the data will be\npruned again eventually once the block file it is persisted in is selected for\npruning. This is consistent with the behaviour of getblockfrompeer where the\nblock is persisted as well even when pruning. (#31175)\n\n\ngetmininginfo now returns nBits and the current target in the target field. It also returns a next object which specifies the height, nBits, difficulty, and target for the next block. (#31583)\n\n\ngetblock and getblockheader now return the current target in the target field (#31583)\n\n\ngetblockchaininfo and getchainstates now return nBits and the current target in the target field (#31583)\n\n\nthe getblocktemplate RPC curtime (BIP22) and mintime (BIP23) fields now\naccount for the timewarp fix proposed in BIP94 on all networks. This ensures\nthat, in the event a timewarp fix softfork activates on mainnet, un-upgraded\nminers will not accidentally violate the timewarp rule. (#31376, #31600)\nAs a reminder, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important that any software which uses the getblocktemplate\nRPC takes these values into account (either curtime or mintime is fine).\nRelying only on a clock can lead to invalid blocks under some circumstances,\nespecially once a timewarp fix is deployed. (#31600)\n\n\nNew RPCs\n\ngetdescriptoractivity can be used to find all spend/receive activity relevant to\na given set of descriptors within a set of specified blocks. This call can be used with\nscanblocks to lessen the need for additional indexing programs. (#30708)\n\nUpdated REST APIs\n\nGET /rest/block/<BLOCK-HASH>.json and GET /rest/headers/<BLOCK-HASH>.json now return the current target in the target field\n\nUpdated Settings\n\n\nThe maximum allowed value for the -dbcache configuration option has been\ndropped due to recent UTXO set growth. Note that before this change, large -dbcache\nvalues were automatically reduced to 16 GiB (1 GiB on 32 bit systems). (#28358)\n\n\nHandling of negated -noseednode, -nobind, -nowhitebind, -norpcbind, -norpcallowip, -norpcwhitelist, -notest, -noasmap, -norpcwallet, -noonlynet, and -noexternalip options has changed. Previously negating these options had various confusing and undocumented side effects. Now negating them just resets the settings and restores default behaviors, as if the options were not specified.\n\n\nStarting with v28.0, the -mempoolfullrbf startup option was set to\ndefault to 1. With widespread adoption of this policy, users no longer\nbenefit from disabling it, so the option has been removed, making full\nreplace-by-fee the standard behavior. (#30592)\n\n\nSetting -upnp will now log a warning and be interpreted as -natpmp. Consider using -natpmp directly instead. (#31130, #31916)\n\n\nAs a safety check, Bitcoin core will fail to start when -blockreservedweight init parameter value is lower than 2000 weight units. Bitcoin Core will also fail to start if the -blockmaxweight or -blockreservedweight init parameter exceeds consensus limit of 4,000,000 WU.\n\n\nPassing -debug=0 or -debug=none now behaves like -nodebug: previously set debug categories will be cleared, but subsequent -debug options will still be applied.\n\n\nThe default for -rpcthreads has been changed from 4 to 16, and the default for -rpcworkqueue has been changed from 16 to 64. (#31215).\n\n\nBuild System\nThe build system has been migrated from Autotools to CMake:\n\n\nThe minimum required CMake version is 3.22.\n\n\nIn-source builds are not allowed. When using a subdirectory within the root source tree as a build directory, it is recommended that its name includes the substring \u00e2\u0080\u009cbuild\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\n\nCMake variables may be used to configure the build system. Some defaults have changed. For example, you will now need to add -DWITH_ZMQ=ON to build with zmq and -DBUILD_GUI=ON to build bitcoin-qt. See Autotools to CMake Options Mapping for details.\n\n\nFor single-configuration generators, the default build configuration (CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE) is \u00e2\u0080\u009cRelWithDebInfo\u00e2\u0080\u009d. However, for the \u00e2\u0080\u009cRelease\u00e2\u0080\u009d configuration, CMake defaults to the compiler optimization flag -O3, which has not been extensively tested with Bitcoin Core. Therefore, the build system replaces it with -O2.\n\n\nBy default, the built executables and libraries are located in the bin/ and lib/ subdirectories of the build directory.\n\n\nThe build system supports component\u00e2\u0080\u0090based installation. The names of the installable components coincide with the build target names. For example:\n\n\ncmake -B build\ncmake --build build --target bitcoind\ncmake --install build --component bitcoind\n\n\nIf any of the CPPFLAGS, CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS or LDFLAGS environment variables were used in your Autotools-based build process, you should instead use the corresponding CMake variables (APPEND_CPPFLAGS, APPEND_CFLAGS, APPEND_CXXFLAGS and APPEND_LDFLAGS). Alternatively, if you opt to use the dedicated CMAKE_<...>_FLAGS variables, you must ensure that the resulting compiler or linker invocations are as expected.\n\nFor more detailed guidance on configuring and using CMake, please refer to the official CMake documentation and CMake\u00e2\u0080\u0099s User Interaction Guide. Additionally, consult platform-specific doc/build-*.md build guides for instructions tailored to your operating system.\nLow-Level Changes\nTools and Utilities\n\nA new tool utxo_to_sqlite.py\nconverts a compact-serialized UTXO snapshot (as created with the\ndumptxoutset RPC) to a SQLite3 database. Refer to the script\u00e2\u0080\u0099s --help\noutput for more details. (#27432)\n\nTests\n\nThe BIP94 timewarp attack mitigation (designed for testnet4) is no longer active on the regtest network. (#31156)\n\nDependencies\n\nMiniUPnPc and libnatpmp have been removed as dependencies (#31130, #30043).\n\nCredits\nThanks to everyone who directly contributed to this release:\n\n0xb10c\nAdlai Chandrasekhar\nAfanti\nAlfonso Roman Zubeldia\nam-sq\nAndre\nAndre Alves\nAnthony Towns\nAntoine Poinsot\nAsh Manning\nAva Chow\nBoris Nagaev\nBrandon Odiwuor\nbrunoerg\nChris Stewart\nCory Fields\ncostcould\nDaniel Pfeifer\nDaniela Brozzoni\nDavid Gumberg\ndergoegge\nepysqyli\nespi3\nEval EXEC\nFabian Jahr\nfanquake\nfurszy\nGabriele Bocchi\nglozow\nGreg Sanders\nGutflo\nHennadii Stepanov\nHodlinator\ni-am-yuvi\nion-\nismaelsadeeq\nJadi\nJames O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Beirne\nJeremy Rand\nJon Atack\njurraca\nKay\nkevkevinpal\nl0rinc\nlaanwj\nLarry Ruane\nL\u00c5\u0091rinc\nMaciej S.

If you configured the hidden service manually\nin torrc now you have to change it from <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">HiddenServicePort 8333 127.0.0.1:8334</code> to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">HiddenServicePort 8333\n127.0.0.1:5556</code>, or configure bitcoind with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-bind=127.0.0.1:8334=onion</code> to get the previous behavior.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31223\">#31223</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Upon receiving an orphan transaction (an unconfirmed transaction that spends unknown inputs), the node will attempt to download missing parents from all peers who announced the orphan.

In order to spend any unconfirmed outputs\nfrom this transaction, the spender must also spend\nthis dust in addition to any other desired outputs.\nIn other words, this type of transaction\nshould be created in a transaction package where\nthe dust is both created and spent simultaneously.

As a result the total reserved weight was always <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">8,000 WU</code>, meaning that even when specifying a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-blockmaxweight</code> higher than the default (even to the max of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">4,000,000 WU</code>), the actual block size will never exceed <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">3,992,000 WU</code>.\nThe fix consolidates the reservation into a single place and introduces a new startup option, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-blockreservedweight</code> which specifies the reserved weight directly. The default value of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-blockreservedweight</code> is set to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">8,000 WU</code> to ensure backward compatibility for users who relied on the previous behavior of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-blockmaxweight</code>.\nThe minimum value of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-blockreservedweight</code> is set to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">2,000 WU</code>.

Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on macOS)\nor bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).\nUpgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\npossible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\nwallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\nCompatibility\nBitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\nusing the Linux Kernel 3.17+, macOS 11.0+, and Windows 7 and newer. Bitcoin\nCore should also work on most other UNIX-like systems but is not as\nfrequently tested on them. It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\nunsupported systems.\nNotable changes\nMempool & Policy\nThe minimum block feerate (-blockmintxfee) has been changed to 1 satoshi per kvB. It can still be changed using the\nconfiguration option.\n\nThe default minimum relay feerate (-minrelaytxfee) and incremental relay feerate (-incrementalrelayfee) have been\nchanged to 100 satoshis per kvB. They can still be changed using their respective configuration options, but it is\nrecommended to change both together if you decide to do so.\n    \nOther minimum feerates (e.g. the dust feerate, the minimum returned by the fee estimator, and all feerates used by\nthe wallet) remain unchanged. The mempool minimum feerate still changes in response to high volume.\nNote that unless these lower defaults are widely adopted across the network, transactions created with lower fee\nrates are not guaranteed to propagate or confirm. The wallet feerates remain unchanged; -mintxfee must be changed\nbefore attempting to create transactions with lower feerates using the wallet.\n\n\n#33106 policy: lower the default blockmintxfee,

Bitcoin\nCore should also work on most other UNIX-like systems but is not as\nfrequently tested on them. It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\nunsupported systems.\nNotable changes\nP2P\n\n\nWhen the -port configuration option is used, the default onion listening port will now\nbe derived to be that port + 1 instead of being set to a fixed value (8334 on mainnet).\nThis re-allows setups with multiple local nodes using different -port and not using -bind,\nwhich would lead to a startup failure in v28.0 due to a port collision.\nNote that a HiddenServicePort manually configured in torrc may need adjustment if used in\nconnection with the -port option.\nFor example, if you are using -port=5555 with a non-standard value and not using -bind=...=onion,\npreviously Bitcoin Core would listen for incoming Tor connections on 127.0.0.1:8334.\nNow it would listen on 127.0.0.1:5556 (-port plus one). If you configured the hidden service manually\nin torrc now you have to change it from HiddenServicePort 8333 127.0.0.1:8334 to HiddenServicePort 8333\n127.0.0.1:5556, or configure bitcoind with -bind=127.0.0.1:8334=onion to get the previous behavior.\n(#31223)\n\n\n#30568 addrman: change internal id counting to int64_t\n\n\nKey\n\n#31166 key: clear out secret data in

Bitcoin\nCore should also work on most other UNIX-like systems but is not as\nfrequently tested on them. It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\nunsupported systems.\nNotable changes\nTestnet4/BIP94 support\nSupport for Testnet4 as specified in BIP94\nhas been added. The network can be selected with the -testnet4 option and\nthe section header is also named [testnet4].\nWhile the intention is to phase out support for Testnet3 in an upcoming\nversion, support for it is still available via the known options in this\nrelease. (#29775)\nWindows Data Directory\nThe default data directory on Windows has been moved from C:\\Users\\Username\\AppData\\Roaming\\Bitcoin\nto C:\\Users\\Username\\AppData\\Local\\Bitcoin. Bitcoin Core will check the existence\nof the old directory first and continue to use that directory for backwards\ncompatibility if it is present. (#27064)\nJSON-RPC 2.0 Support\nThe JSON-RPC server now recognizes JSON-RPC 2.0 requests and responds with\nstrict adherence to the specification.\nSee JSON-RPC-interface.md for details. (#27101)\nJSON-RPC clients may need to be updated to be compatible with the JSON-RPC server.\nPlease open an issue on GitHub if any compatibility issues are found.\nlibbitcoinconsensus Removal\nThe libbitcoin-consensus library was deprecated in 27.0 and is now completely removed. (#29648)\nP2P and Network Changes\n\n\nPreviously if Bitcoin Core was listening for P2P connections, either using\ndefault settings or via bind=addr:port it would always also bind to\n127.0.0.1:8334 to listen for Tor connections. It was not possible to switch\nthis off, even if the node didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use Tor. This has been changed and now\nbind=addr:port results in binding on addr:port only. The default behavior\nof binding to 0.0.0.0:8333 and 127.0.0.1:8334 has not been changed.\nIf you are using a bind=... configuration without bind=...=onion and rely\non the previous implied behavior to accept incoming Tor connections at\n127.0.0.1:8334, you need to now make this explicit by using\nbind=... bind=127.0.0.1:8334=onion. (#22729)\n\n\nBitcoin Core will now fail to start up if any of its P2P binds fail, rather\nthan the previous behaviour where it would only abort startup if all P2P\nbinds had failed. (#22729)\n\n\nUNIX domain sockets can now be used for proxy connections. Set -onion or -proxy\nto the local socket path with the prefix unix: (e.g. -onion=unix:/home/me/torsocket).\n(#27375)\n\n\nUNIX socket paths are now accepted for -zmqpubrawblock and -zmqpubrawtx with\nthe format -zmqpubrawtx=unix:/path/to/file (#27679)\n\n\nAdditional \u00e2\u0080\u009cin\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cout\u00e2\u0080\u009d flags have been added to -whitelist to control whether\npermissions apply to inbound connections and/or manual ones (default: inbound only). (#27114)\n\n\nTransactions having a feerate that is too low will be opportunistically paired with\ntheir child transactions and submitted as a package, thus enabling the node to download\n1-parent-1-child packages using the existing transaction relay protocol. Combined with\nother mempool policies, this change allows limited \u00e2\u0080\u009cpackage relay\u00e2\u0080\u009d when a parent transaction\nis below the mempool minimum feerate. Topologically Restricted Until Confirmation (TRUC)\nparents are additionally allowed to be below the minimum relay feerate (i.e., pay 0 fees).\nUse the submitpackage RPC to submit packages directly to the node. Warning: this P2P\nfeature is limited (unlike the submitpackage interface, a child with multiple unconfirmed\nparents is not supported) and not yet reliable under adversarial conditions. (#28970)\n\n\nMempool Policy Changes\n\n\nTransactions with version number set to 3 are now treated as standard on all networks (#29496),\nsubject to opt-in Topologically Restricted Until Confirmation (TRUC) transaction policy as\ndescribed in BIP 431.  The\npolicy includes limits on spending unconfirmed outputs (#28948), eviction of a previous descendant\nif a more incentive-compatible one is submitted (#29306), and a maximum transaction size of 10,000vB\n(#29873). These restrictions simplify the assessment of incentive compatibility of accepting or\nreplacing TRUC transactions, thus ensuring any replacements are more profitable for the node and\nmaking fee-bumping more reliable.\n\n\nPay To Anchor (P2A) is a new standard witness output type for spending,\na newly recognised output template. This allows for key-less anchor\noutputs, with compact spending conditions for additional efficiencies on\ntop of an equivalent sh(OP_TRUE) output, in addition to the txid stability\nof the spending transaction.\nN.B. propagation of this output spending on the network will be limited\nuntil a sufficient number of nodes on the network adopt this upgrade. (#30352)\n\n\nLimited package RBF is now enabled, where the proposed conflicting package would result in\na connected component, aka cluster, of size 2 in the mempool. All clusters being conflicted\nagainst must be of size 2 or lower. (#28984)\n\n\nThe default value of the -mempoolfullrbf configuration option has been changed from 0 to 1,\ni.e. mempoolfullrbf=1. (#30493)\n\n\nUpdated RPCs\n\n\nThe dumptxoutset RPC now returns the UTXO set dump in a new and\nimproved format. Correspondingly, the loadtxoutset RPC now expects\nthis new format in the dumps it tries to load. Dumps with the old\nformat are no longer supported and need to be recreated using the\nnew format to be usable. (#29612)\n\n\nAssumeUTXO mainnet parameters have been added for height 840,000.\nThis means the loadtxoutset RPC can now be used on mainnet with\nthe matching UTXO set from that height. (#28553)\n\n\nThe warnings field in getblockchaininfo, getmininginfo and\ngetnetworkinfo now returns all the active node warnings as an array\nof strings, instead of a single warning. The current behaviour\ncan be temporarily restored by running Bitcoin Core with the configuration\noption -deprecatedrpc=warnings. (#29845)\n\n\nPreviously when using the sendrawtransaction RPC and specifying outputs\nthat are already in the UTXO set, an RPC error code of -27 with the\nmessage \u00e2\u0080\u009cTransaction already in block chain\u00e2\u0080\u009d was returned in response.\nThe error message has been changed to \u00e2\u0080\u009cTransaction outputs already in utxo set\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nto more accurately describe the source of the issue. (#30212)\n\n\nThe default mode for the estimatesmartfee RPC has been updated from conservative to economical,\nwhich is expected to reduce over-estimation for many users, particularly if Replace-by-Fee is an option.\nFor users that require high confidence in their fee estimates at the cost of potentially over-estimating,\nthe conservative mode remains available. (#30275)\n\n\nRPC scantxoutset now returns 2 new fields in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cunspents\u00e2\u0080\u009d JSON array: blockhash and confirmations.\nSee the scantxoutset help for details. (#30515)\n\n\nRPC submitpackage now allows 2 new arguments to be passed: maxfeerate and maxburnamount. See the\nsubtmitpackage help for details. (#28950)\n\n\nChanges to wallet-related RPCs can be found in the Wallet section below.\nUpdated REST APIs\n\nParameter validation for /rest/getutxos has been improved by rejecting\ntruncated or overly large txids and malformed outpoint indices via raising\nan HTTP_BAD_REQUEST \u00e2\u0080\u009cParse error\u00e2\u0080\u009d. These requests were previously handled\nsilently. (#30482, #30444)\n\nBuild System\n\n\nGCC 11.1 or later, or Clang 16.0 or later,\nare now required to compile Bitcoin Core. (#29091, #30263)\n\n\nThe minimum required glibc to run Bitcoin Core is now\n2.31. This means that RHEL 8 and Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic)\nare no-longer supported. (#29987)\n\n\n--enable-lcov-branch-coverage has been removed, given\nincompatibilities between lcov version 1 & 2. LCOV_OPTS\nshould be used to set any options instead. (#30192)\n\n\nUpdated Settings\n\nWhen running with -alertnotify, an alert can now be raised multiple\ntimes instead of just once. Previously, it was only raised when unknown\nnew consensus rules were activated. Its scope has now been increased to\ninclude all kernel warnings. Specifically, alerts will now also be raised\nwhen an invalid chain with a large amount of work has been detected.\nAdditional warnings may be added in the future. (#30058)\n\nChanges to GUI or wallet related settings can be found in the GUI or Wallet section below.\nWallet\n\n\nThe wallet now detects when wallet transactions conflict with the mempool. Mempool-conflicting\ntransactions can be seen in the \"mempoolconflicts\" field of gettransaction. The inputs\nof mempool-conflicted transactions can now be respent without manually abandoning the\ntransactions when the parent transaction is dropped from the mempool, which can cause wallet\nbalances to appear higher. (#27307)\n\n\nA new max_tx_weight option has been added to the RPCs fundrawtransaction, walletcreatefundedpsbt, and send. \nIt specifies the maximum transaction weight. If the limit is exceeded during funding, the transaction will not be built. \nThe default value is 4,000,000 WU. (#29523)\n\n\nA new createwalletdescriptor RPC allows users to add new automatically generated\ndescriptors to their wallet. This can be used to upgrade wallets created prior to the\nintroduction of a new standard descriptor, such as taproot. (#29130)\n\n\nA new RPC gethdkeys lists all of the BIP32 HD keys in use by all of the descriptors in the wallet.\nThese keys can be used in conjunction with createwalletdescriptor to create and add single key\ndescriptors to the wallet for a particular key that the wallet already knows. (#29130)\n\n\nThe sendall RPC can now spend unconfirmed change and will include additional fees as necessary\nfor the resulting transaction to bump the unconfirmed transactions\u00e2\u0080\u0099 feerates to the specified feerate. (#28979)\n\n\nIn RPC bumpfee, if a fee_rate is specified, the feerate is no longer restricted\nto following the wallet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s incremental feerate of 5 sat/vb. The feerate must still be\nat least the sum of the original fee and the mempool\u00e2\u0080\u0099s incremental feerate. (#27969)\n\n\nGUI Changes\n\n\nThe \u00e2\u0080\u009cMigrate Wallet\u00e2\u0080\u009d menu allows users to migrate any legacy wallet in their wallet\ndirectory, regardless of the wallets loaded. (gui#824)\n\n\nThe \u00e2\u0080\u009cInformation\u00e2\u0080\u009d window now displays the maximum mempool size along with the\nmempool usage. (gui#825)\n\n\nLow-level Changes\nTests\n\n\nThe BIP94 timewarp attack mitigation is now active on the regtest network. (#30681)\n\n\nA new -testdatadir option has been added to test_bitcoin to allow specifying the\nlocation of unit test data directories. (#26564)\n\n\nBlockstorage\n\nBlock files are now XOR\u00e2\u0080\u0099d by default with a key stored in the blocksdir.\nPrevious releases of Bitcoin Core or previous external software will not be able to read the blocksdir with a non-zero XOR-key.\nRefer to the -blocksxor help for more details. (#28052)\n\nChainstate\n\nThe chainstate database flushes that occur when blocks are pruned will no longer\nempty the database cache. The cache will remain populated longer, which significantly\nreduces the time for initial block download to complete. (#28280)\n\nDependencies\n\nThe dependency on Boost.Process has been replaced with cpp-subprocess, which is contained in source.\nBuilders will no longer need Boost.Process to build with external signer support.

It was not possible to switch\nthis off, even if the node didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use Tor. This has been changed and now\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bind=addr:port</code> results in binding on <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">addr:port</code> only. The default behavior\nof binding to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">0.0.0.0:8333</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">127.0.0.1:8334</code> has not been changed.</p>\n<p>If you are using a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bind=...</code> configuration without <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bind=...=onion</code> and rely\non the previous implied behavior to accept incoming Tor connections at\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">127.0.0.1:8334</code>, you need to now make this explicit by using\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bind=... bind=127.0.0.1:8334=onion</code>. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22729\">#22729</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bitcoin Core will now fail to start up if any of its P2P binds fail, rather\nthan the previous behaviour where it would only abort startup if all P2P\nbinds had failed. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22729\">#22729</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>UNIX domain sockets can now be used for proxy connections. Set <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-onion</code> or <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-proxy</code>\nto the local socket path with the prefix <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">unix:</code> (e.g. <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-onion=unix:/home/me/torsocket</code>).\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27375\">#27375</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>UNIX socket paths are now accepted for <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-zmqpubrawblock</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-zmqpubrawtx</code> with\nthe format <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-zmqpubrawtx=unix:/path/to/file</code> (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27679\">#27679</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Additional \u00e2\u0080\u009cin\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cout\u00e2\u0080\u009d flags have been added to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-whitelist</code> to control whether\npermissions apply to inbound connections and/or manual ones (default: inbound only). (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27114\">#27114</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Transactions having a feerate that is too low will be opportunistically paired with\ntheir child transactions and submitted as a package, thus enabling the node to download\n1-parent-1-child packages using the existing transaction relay protocol. Combined with\nother mempool policies, this change allows limited \u00e2\u0080\u009cpackage relay\u00e2\u0080\u009d when a parent transaction\nis below the mempool minimum feerate. Topologically Restricted Until Confirmation (TRUC)\nparents are additionally allowed to be below the minimum relay feerate (i.e., pay 0 fees).\nUse the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">submitpackage</code> RPC to submit packages directly to the node. Warning: this P2P\nfeature is limited (unlike the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">submitpackage</code> interface, a child with multiple unconfirmed\nparents is not supported) and not yet reliable under adversarial conditions. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28970\">#28970</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"mempool-policy-changes\">Mempool Policy Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Transactions with version number set to 3 are now treated as standard on all networks (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29496\">#29496</a>),\nsubject to opt-in Topologically Restricted Until Confirmation (TRUC) transaction policy as\ndescribed in <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0431.mediawiki\">BIP 431</a>.

These restrictions simplify the assessment of incentive compatibility of accepting or\nreplacing TRUC transactions, thus ensuring any replacements are more profitable for the node and\nmaking fee-bumping more reliable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pay To Anchor (P2A) is a new standard witness output type for spending,\na newly recognised output template. This allows for key-less anchor\noutputs, with compact spending conditions for additional efficiencies on\ntop of an equivalent <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">sh(OP_TRUE)</code> output, in addition to the txid stability\nof the spending transaction.\nN.B. propagation of this output spending on the network will be limited\nuntil a sufficient number of nodes on the network adopt this upgrade. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30352\">#30352</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Limited package RBF is now enabled, where the proposed conflicting package would result in\na connected component, aka cluster, of size 2 in the mempool. All clusters being conflicted\nagainst must be of size 2 or lower. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28984\">#28984</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The default value of the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-mempoolfullrbf</code> configuration option has been changed from 0 to 1,\ni.e. <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">mempoolfullrbf=1</code>.

Correspondingly, the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">loadtxoutset</code> RPC now expects\nthis new format in the dumps it tries to load. Dumps with the old\nformat are no longer supported and need to be recreated using the\nnew format to be usable. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29612\">#29612</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>AssumeUTXO mainnet parameters have been added for height 840,000.\nThis means the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">loadtxoutset</code> RPC can now be used on mainnet with\nthe matching UTXO set from that height.

Previously, it was only raised when unknown\nnew consensus rules were activated. Its scope has now been increased to\ninclude all kernel warnings. Specifically, alerts will now also be raised\nwhen an invalid chain with a large amount of work has been detected.\nAdditional warnings may be added in the future. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30058\">#30058</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Changes to GUI or wallet related settings can be found in the GUI or Wallet section below.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wallet\">Wallet</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The wallet now detects when wallet transactions conflict with the mempool. Mempool-conflicting\ntransactions can be seen in the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">\"mempoolconflicts\"</code> field of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">gettransaction</code>. The inputs\nof mempool-conflicted transactions can now be respent without manually abandoning the\ntransactions when the parent transaction is dropped from the mempool, which can cause wallet\nbalances to appear higher.

If the limit is exceeded during funding, the transaction will not be built. \nThe default value is 4,000,000 WU. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29523\">#29523</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A new <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">createwalletdescriptor</code> RPC allows users to add new automatically generated\ndescriptors to their wallet. This can be used to upgrade wallets created prior to the\nintroduction of a new standard descriptor, such as taproot. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29130\">#29130</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A new RPC <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">gethdkeys</code> lists all of the BIP32 HD keys in use by all of the descriptors in the wallet.\nThese keys can be used in conjunction with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">createwalletdescriptor</code> to create and add single key\ndescriptors to the wallet for a particular key that the wallet already knows. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29130\">#29130</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">sendall</code> RPC can now spend unconfirmed change and will include additional fees as necessary\nfor the resulting transaction to bump the unconfirmed transactions\u00e2\u0080\u0099 feerates to the specified feerate. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28979\">#28979</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In RPC <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bumpfee</code>, if a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">fee_rate</code> is specified, the feerate is no longer restricted\nto following the wallet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s incremental feerate of 5 sat/vb. The feerate must still be\nat least the sum of the original fee and the mempool\u00e2\u0080\u0099s incremental feerate.

Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on macOS)\nor bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).\nUpgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\npossible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\nwallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\nCompatibility\nBitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\nusing the Linux Kernel 3.17+, macOS 11.0+, and Windows 7 and newer. Bitcoin\nCore should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\nfrequently tested on them. It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\nunsupported systems.\nNotable changes\nlibbitcoinconsensus\n\n\nlibbitcoinconsensus is deprecated and will be removed for v28. This library has\nexisted for nearly 10 years with very little known uptake or impact. It has\nbecome a maintenance burden.\nThe underlying functionality does not change between versions, so any users of\nthe library can continue to use the final release indefinitely, with the\nunderstanding that Taproot is its final consensus update.\nIn the future, libbitcoinkernel will provide a much more useful API that is\naware of the UTXO set, and therefore be able to fully validate transactions and\nblocks. (#29189)\n\n\nmempool.dat compatibility\n\n\nThe mempool.dat file created by -persistmempool or the savemempool RPC will\nbe written in a new format. This new format includes the XOR\u00e2\u0080\u0099ing of transaction\ncontents to mitigate issues where external programs (such as anti-virus) attempt\nto interpret and potentially modify the file.\nThis new format can not be read by previous software releases. To allow for a\ndowngrade, a temporary setting -persistmempoolv1 has been added to fall back\nto the legacy format. (#28207)\n\n\nP2P and network changes\n\nBIP324 v2 transport is now enabled by default. It remains possible to disable v2\nby running with -v2transport=0. (#29347)\n\nManual connection options (-connect, -addnode and -seednode) will\nnow follow -v2transport to connect with v2 by default. They will retry with\nv1 on failure. (#29058)\n\nNetwork-adjusted time has been removed from consensus code. It is replaced\nwith (unadjusted) system time. The warning for a large median time offset\n(70 minutes or more) is kept. This removes the implicit security assumption of\nrequiring an honest majority of outbound peers, and increases the importance\nof the node operator ensuring their system time is (and stays) correct to not\nfall out of consensus with the network. (#28956)\n\nMempool Policy Changes\n\nOpt-in Topologically Restricted Until Confirmation (TRUC) Transactions policy\n(aka v3 transaction policy) is available for use on test networks when\n-acceptnonstdtxn=1 is set. By setting the transaction version number to 3, TRUC transactions\nrequest the application of limits on spending of their unconfirmed outputs. These\nrestrictions simplify the assessment of incentive compatibility of accepting or\nreplacing TRUC transactions, thus ensuring any replacements are more profitable for\nthe node and making fee-bumping more reliable. TRUC transactions are currently\nnonstandard and can only be used on test networks where the standardness rules are\nrelaxed or disabled (e.g. with -acceptnonstdtxn=1). (#28948)\n\nExternal Signing\n\nSupport for external signing on Windows has been disabled. It will be re-enabled\nonce the underlying dependency (Boost Process), has been replaced with a different\nlibrary. (#28967)\n\nUpdated RPCs\n\nThe addnode RPC now follows the -v2transport option (now on by default, see above) for making connections.\nIt remains possible to specify the transport type manually with the v2transport argument of addnode. (#29239)\n\nBuild System\n\nA C++20 capable compiler is now required to build Bitcoin Core. (#28349)\nMacOS releases are configured to use the hardened runtime libraries (#29127)\n\nWallet\n\nThe CoinGrinder coin selection algorithm has been introduced to mitigate unnecessary\nlarge input sets and lower transaction costs at high feerates. CoinGrinder\nsearches for the input set with minimal weight. Solutions found by\nCoinGrinder will produce a change output. CoinGrinder is only active at\nelevated feerates (default: 30+\u00e2\u0080\u00afsat/vB, based on -consolidatefeerate\u00c3\u00973). (#27877)\nThe Branch And Bound coin selection algorithm will be disabled when the subtract fee\nfrom outputs feature is used. (#28994)\nIf the birth time of a descriptor is detected to be later than the first transaction\ninvolving that descriptor, the birth time will be reset to the earlier time. (#28920)\n\nLow-level changes\nPruning\n\nWhen pruning during initial block download, more blocks will be pruned at each\nflush in order to speed up the syncing of such nodes. (#20827)\n\nInit\n\nVarious fixes to prevent issues where subsequent instances of Bitcoin Core would\nresult in deletion of files in use by an existing instance. (#28784, #28946)\nImproved handling of empty settings.json files. (#29144)\n\nCredits\nThanks to everyone who directly contributed to this release:\n\n22388o\u00e2\u009a\u00a1\u00ef\u00b8\u008f\nAaron Clauson\nAmiti Uttarwar\nAndrew Toth\nAnthony Towns\nAntoine Poinsot\nAva Chow\nBrandon Odiwuor\nbrunoerg\nChris Stewart\nCory Fields\ndergoegge\ndjschnei21\nFabian Jahr\nfanquake\nfurszy\nGloria Zhao\nGreg Sanders\nHennadii Stepanov\nHernan Marino\niamcarlos94\nismaelsadeeq\nJameson Lopp\nJesse Barton\nJohn Moffett\nJon Atack\njosibake\njrakibi\nJustin Dhillon\nKashif Smith\nkevkevin\nKristaps Kaupe\nL0la L33tz\nLuke Dashjr\nL\u00c5\u0091rinc\nmarco\nMarcoFalke\nMark Friedenbach\nMarnix\nMartin Leitner-Ankerl\nMartin Zumsande\nMax Edwards\nMurch\nmuxator\nnaiyoma\nNikodemas Tuckus\nns-xvrn\npablomartin4btc\nPeter Todd\nPieter Wuille\nRichard Myers\nRoman Zeyde\nRussell Yanofsky\nRyan Ofsky\nSebastian Falbesoner\nSergi Delgado Segura\nSjors Provoost\nstickies-v\nstratospher\nSupachai Kheawjuy\nTheCharlatan\nUdjinM6\nVasil Dimov\nw0xlt\nwillcl-ark\n\nAs well as to everyone that helped with translations on\nTransifex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\nLegal | Privacy Policy | RSS \n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2025 Bitcoin Core\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<!--[if lt IE 7]><html class=\"no-js lt-ie9 lt-ie8 lt-ie7\" lang=\"en\"> <![endif]-->\n<!--[if (IE 7)&!(IEMobile)]><html class=\"no-js lt-ie9 lt-ie8\" lang=\"en\"><![endif]-->\n<!--[if (IE 8)&!(IEMobile)]><html class=\"no-js lt-ie9\" lang=\"en\"><![endif]-->\n<!--[if gt IE 8]><!--> <html class=\"no-js\" lang=\"en\"><!--<![endif]-->\n<head>\n<!-- source: '_releases/27.0.md' -->\n<!-- name: 'release-27.0' -->\n<!-- version:  -->\n<!-- translated:  -->\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\"/>\n<title>Bitcoin Core :: Bitcoin Core 27.0</title>\n<meta content=\"Bitcoin Core 27.0\" name=\"description\"/>\n<meta content=\"\" name=\"keywords\"/>\n<meta content=\"http://6hasakffvppilxgehrswmffqurlcjjjhd76jgvaqmsg6ul25s7t3rzyd.onion/en/releases/27.0/\" http-equiv=\"onion-location\">\n<!-- Twitter Cards -->\n<meta content=\"Bitcoin Core 27.0\" name=\"twitter:title\"/>\n<meta content=\"Bitcoin Core 27.0\" name=\"twitter:description\"/>\n<meta content=\"@bitcoincoreorg\" name=\"twitter:site\"/>\n<meta content=\"@bitcoincoreorg\" name=\"twitter:creator\"/>\n<meta content=\"summary\" name=\"twitter:card\"/>\n<meta content=\"https://bitcoincore.org/assets/images/default-thumb.png\" name=\"twitter:image\"/>\n<!-- Open Graph -->\n<meta content=\"en\" property=\"og:locale\"/>\n<meta content=\"article\" property=\"og:type\"/>\n<meta content=\"Bitcoin Core 27.0\" property=\"og:title\"/>\n<meta content=\"Bitcoin Core 27.0\" property=\"og:description\"/>\n<meta content=\"https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/27.0/\" property=\"og:url\"/>\n<meta content=\"Bitcoin Core\" property=\"og:site_name\"/>\n<meta content=\"https://bitcoincore.org/assets/images/default-thumb.png\" property=\"og:image\"/>\n<link href=\"https://bitcoincore.org/ja/releases/27.0/\" hreflang=\"ja\" rel=\"alternate\"/>\n<link href=\"https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/27.0/\" rel=\"canonical\"/>\n<link href=\"https://bitcoincore.org/en/feed.xml\" rel=\"alternate\" title=\"Bitcoin Core Blog XML Feed\" type=\"application/atom+xml\"/>\n<link href=\"https://bitcoincore.org/en/rss.xml\" rel=\"alternate\" title=\"Bitcoin Core Blog RSS Feed\" type=\"application/rss+xml\"/>\n<link href=\"https://bitcoincore.org/en/meetingrss.xml\" rel=\"alternate\" title=\"Bitcoin Core Meeting RSS Feed\" type=\"application/rss+xml\"/>\n<!-- http://t.co/dKP3o1e -->\n<meta content=\"True\" name=\"HandheldFriendly\"/>\n<meta content=\"320\" name=\"MobileOptimized\"/>\n<meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\" name=\"viewport\"/>\n<!-- For all browsers -->\n<link href=\"/assets/css/main.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\"/>\n<meta content=\"on\" http-equiv=\"cleartype\"/>\n<!-- Icons -->\n<link href=\"/assets/images/favicon.ico\" rel=\"shortcut icon\"/><!-- 16x16 -->\n<link href=\"/assets/images/favicon.png\" rel=\"shortcut icon\"/><!-- 32x32 -->\n<link href=\"/assets/images/apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png\" rel=\"apple-touch-icon-precomposed\"/><!-- 57x57 (precomposed) for iPhone 3GS, pre-2011 iPod Touch and older Android devices -->\n<link href=\"/assets/images/apple-touch-icon-72x72-precomposed.png\" rel=\"apple-touch-icon-precomposed\" sizes=\"72x72\"/><!-- 72x72 (precomposed) for 1st generation iPad, iPad 2 and iPad mini -->\n<link href=\"/assets/images/apple-touch-icon-114x114-precomposed.png\" rel=\"apple-touch-icon-precomposed\" sizes=\"114x114\"/><!-- 114x114 (precomposed) for iPhone 4, 4S, 5 and post-2011 iPod Touch -->\n<link href=\"/assets/images/apple-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png\" rel=\"apple-touch-icon-precomposed\" sizes=\"144x144\"/><!-- 144x144 (precomposed) for iPad 3rd and 4th generation -->\n<!-- Hide Searchbar if nojs -->\n<noscript>\n<style>\n      #searchbar { display:none;

It is replaced\nwith (unadjusted) system time. The warning for a large median time offset\n(70 minutes or more) is kept.

These\nrestrictions simplify the assessment of incentive compatibility of accepting or\nreplacing TRUC transactions, thus ensuring any replacements are more profitable for\nthe node and making fee-bumping more reliable. TRUC transactions are currently\nnonstandard and can only be used on test networks where the standardness rules are\nrelaxed or disabled (e.g. with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-acceptnonstdtxn=1</code>).

Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on macOS)\nor bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).\nUpgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\npossible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\nwallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\nCompatibility\nBitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\nusing the Linux kernel, macOS 11.0+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Bitcoin\nCore should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\nfrequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\nunsupported systems.\nNotable changes\nScript\n\n#29853: sign: don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t assume we are parsing a sane TapMiniscript\n\nP2P and network

Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on macOS)\nor bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).\nUpgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\npossible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\nwallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\nCompatibility\nBitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\nusing the Linux kernel, macOS 11.0+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Bitcoin\nCore should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\nfrequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\nunsupported systems.\nNotable changes\nP2P and network changes\n\n\nExperimental support for the v2 transport protocol defined in\nBIP324 was added.\nIt is off by default, but when enabled using -v2transport it will be negotiated\non a per-connection basis with other peers that support it too. The existing\nv1 transport protocol remains fully supported.\n\n\nNodes with multiple reachable networks will actively try to have at least one\noutbound connection to each network. This improves individual resistance to\neclipse attacks and network level resistance to partition attacks. Users no\nlonger need to perform active measures to ensure being connected to multiple\nenabled networks. (#27213)\n\n\nPruning\n\nWhen using assumeutxo with -prune, the prune budget may be exceeded if it is set\nlower than 1100MB (i.e. MIN_DISK_SPACE_FOR_BLOCK_FILES * 2). Prune budget is normally\nsplit evenly across each chainstate, unless the resulting prune budget per chainstate\nis beneath MIN_DISK_SPACE_FOR_BLOCK_FILES in which case that value will be used. (#27596)\n\nUpdated RPCs\n\n\nSetting -rpcserialversion=0 is deprecated and will be removed in\na future release. It can currently still be used by also adding\nthe -deprecatedrpc=serialversion option. (#28448)\n\n\nThe hash_serialized_2 value has been removed from gettxoutsetinfo since the value it\ncalculated contained a bug and did not take all data into account. It is superseded by\nhash_serialized_3 which provides the same functionality but serves the correctly calculated hash. (#28685)\n\n\nNew fields transport_protocol_type and session_id were added to the getpeerinfo RPC to indicate\nwhether the v2 transport protocol is in use, and if so, what the session id is.\n\n\nA new argument v2transport was added to the addnode RPC to indicate whether a v2 transaction connection\nis to be attempted with the peer.\n\n\nMiniscript expressions can now be used in Taproot descriptors for all RPCs working with descriptors. (#27255)\n\n\nfinalizepsbt is now able to finalize a PSBT with inputs spending Miniscript-compatible Taproot leaves. (#27255)\n\n\nChanges to wallet related RPCs can be found in the Wallet section below.\nNew RPCs\n\n\nloadtxoutset has been added, which allows loading a UTXO snapshot of the format\ngenerated by dumptxoutset. Once this snapshot is loaded, its contents will be\ndeserialized into a second chainstate data structure, which is then used to sync to\nthe network\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tip.\nMeanwhile, the original chainstate will complete the initial block download process in\nthe background, eventually validating up to the block that the snapshot is based upon.\nThe result is a usable bitcoind instance that is current with the network tip in a\nmatter of minutes rather than hours. UTXO snapshot are typically obtained via\nthird-party sources (HTTP, torrent, etc.) which is reasonable since their contents\nare always checked by hash.\nYou can find more information on this process in the assumeutxo design\ndocument (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/design/assumeutxo.md).\ngetchainstates has been added to aid in monitoring the assumeutxo sync process.\n\n\nA new getprioritisedtransactions RPC has been added. It returns a map of all fee deltas created by the\nuser with prioritisetransaction, indexed by txid. The map also indicates whether each transaction is\npresent in the mempool. (#27501)\n\n\nA new RPC, submitpackage, has been added. It can be used to submit a list of raw hex\ntransactions to the mempool to be evaluated as a package using consensus and mempool policy rules.\nThese policies include package CPFP, allowing a child with high fees to bump a parent below the\nmempool minimum feerate (but not minimum relay feerate). (#27609)\n\n\nWarning: successful submission does not mean the transactions will propagate throughout the\nnetwork, as package relay is not supported.\n\n\nNot all features are available. The package is limited to a child with all of its\nunconfirmed parents, and no parent may spend the output of another parent.  Also, package\nRBF is not supported. Refer to doc/policy/packages.md for more details on package policies\nand limitations.\n\n\nThis RPC is experimental. Its interface may change.\n\n\n\n\nA new RPC getaddrmaninfo has been added to view the distribution of addresses in the new and tried table of the\nnode\u00e2\u0080\u0099s address manager across different networks(ipv4, ipv6, onion, i2p, cjdns). The RPC returns count of addresses\nin new and tried table as well as their sum for all networks. (#27511)\n\n\nA new importmempool RPC has been added. It loads a valid mempool.dat file and attempts to\nadd its contents to the mempool. This can be useful to import mempool data from another node\nwithout having to modify the datadir contents and without having to restart the node. (#27460)\n\nWarning: Importing untrusted files is dangerous, especially if metadata from the file is taken over.\nIf you want to apply fee deltas, it is recommended to use the getprioritisedtransactions and\nprioritisetransaction RPCs instead of the apply_fee_delta_priority option to avoid\ndouble-prioritising any already-prioritised transactions in the mempool.\n\n\n\nUpdated settings\n\n\nbitcoind and bitcoin-qt will now raise an error on startup\n if a datadir that is being used contains a bitcoin.conf file that\n will be ignored, which can happen when a datadir= line is used in\n a bitcoin.conf file. The error message is just a diagnostic intended\n to prevent accidental misconfiguration, and it can be disabled to\n restore the previous behavior of using the datadir while ignoring\n the bitcoin.conf contained in it. (#27302)\n\n\nPassing an invalid -debug, -debugexclude, or -loglevel logging configuration\noption now raises an error, rather than logging an easily missed warning. (#27632)\n\n\nChanges to GUI or wallet related settings can be found in the GUI or Wallet section below.\nNew settings\nTools and Utilities\n\nA new bitcoinconsensus_verify_script_with_spent_outputs function is available in libconsensus which optionally accepts the spent outputs of the transaction being verified.\nA new bitcoinconsensus_SCRIPT_FLAGS_VERIFY_TAPROOT flag is available in libconsensus that will verify scripts with the Taproot spending rules.\n\nWallet\n\n\nWallet loading has changed in this release. Wallets with some corrupted records that could be\npreviously loaded (with warnings) may no longer load. For example, wallets with corrupted\naddress book entries may no longer load. If this happens, it is recommended\nload the wallet in a previous version of Bitcoin Core and import the data into a new wallet.\nPlease also report an issue to help improve the software and make wallet loading more robust\nin these cases. (#24914)\n\n\nThe createwallet RPC will no longer create legacy (BDB) wallets when\nsetting descriptors=false without also providing the\n-deprecatedrpc=create_bdb option. This is because the legacy wallet is\nbeing deprecated in a future release. (#28597)\n\n\nThe gettransaction, listtransactions, listsinceblock RPCs now return\nthe abandoned field for all transactions. Previously, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cabandoned\u00e2\u0080\u009d field\nwas only returned for sent transactions. (#25158)\n\n\nThe listdescriptors, decodepsbt and similar RPC methods now show h rather than apostrophe (') to indicate\nhardened derivation. This does not apply when using the private parameter, which\nmatches the marker used when descriptor was generated or imported. Newly created\nwallets use h. This change makes it easier to handle descriptor strings manually.\nE.g. the importdescriptors RPC call is easiest to use h as the marker: '[\"desc\": \".../0h/...\"]'.\nWith this change listdescriptors will use h, so you can copy-paste the result,\nwithout having to add escape characters or switch ' to \u00e2\u0080\u0098h\u00e2\u0080\u0099 manually.\nNote that this changes the descriptor checksum.\nFor legacy wallets the hdkeypath field in getaddressinfo is unchanged,\nnor is the serialization format of wallet dumps. (#26076)\n\n\nThe getbalances RPC now returns a lastprocessedblock JSON object which contains the wallet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s last processed block\nhash and height at the time the balances were calculated. This result shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be cached because importing new keys could invalidate it. (#26094)\n\n\nThe gettransaction RPC now returns a lastprocessedblock JSON object which contains the wallet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s last processed block\nhash and height at the time the transaction information was generated. (#26094)\n\n\nThe getwalletinfo RPC now returns a lastprocessedblock JSON object which contains the wallet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s last processed block\nhash and height at the time the wallet information was generated. (#26094)\n\n\nCoin selection and transaction building now accounts for unconfirmed low-feerate ancestor transactions. When it is necessary to spend unconfirmed outputs, the wallet will add fees to ensure that the new transaction with its ancestors will achieve a mining score equal to the feerate requested by the user. (#26152)\n\n\nFor RPC methods which accept options parameters ((importmulti, listunspent,\nfundrawtransaction, bumpfee, send, sendall, walletcreatefundedpsbt,\nsimulaterawtransaction), it is now possible to pass the options as named\nparameters without the need for a nested object. (#26485)\n\n\nThis means it is possible make calls like:\nsrc/bitcoin-cli -named bumpfee txid fee_rate=100\n\ninstead of\nsrc/bitcoin-cli -named bumpfee txid options='{\"fee_rate\": 100}'\n\n\n\nThe deprecatedrpc=walletwarningfield configuration option has been removed.\nThe createwallet, loadwallet, restorewallet and unloadwallet RPCs no\nlonger return the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwarning\u00e2\u0080\u009d string field. The same information is provided\nthrough the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwarnings\u00e2\u0080\u009d field added in v25.0, which returns a JSON array of\nstrings. The \u00e2\u0080\u009cwarning\u00e2\u0080\u009d string field was deprecated also in v25.0. (#27757)\n\n\nThe signrawtransactionwithkey, signrawtransactionwithwallet,\nwalletprocesspsbt and descriptorprocesspsbt calls now return the more\nspecific RPC_INVALID_PARAMETER error instead of RPC_MISC_ERROR if their\nsighashtype argument is malformed. (#28113)\n\n\nRPC walletprocesspsbt, and descriptorprocesspsbt return\nobject now includes field hex (if the transaction\nis complete) containing the serialized transaction\nsuitable for RPC sendrawtransaction. (#28414)\n\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s now possible to use Miniscript inside Taproot leaves for descriptor wallets. (#27255)\n\n\nDescriptors\n\nThe usage of hybrid public keys in output descriptors has been removed. Hybrid\npublic keys are an exotic public key encoding not supported by output descriptors\n(as specified in BIP380 and documented in doc/descriptors.md). Bitcoin Core would\npreviously incorrectly accept descriptors containing such hybrid keys. (#28587)\n\nGUI changes\n\n\nThe transaction list in the GUI no longer provides a special category for \u00e2\u0080\u009cpayment to yourself\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Now transactions that have both inputs and outputs that affect the wallet are displayed on separate lines for spending and receiving. (gui#119)\n\n\nA new menu option allows migrating a legacy wallet based on keys and implied output script types stored in BerkeleyDB (BDB) to a modern wallet that uses descriptors stored in SQLite. (gui#738)\n\n\nThe PSBT operations dialog marks outputs paying your own wallet with \u00e2\u0080\u009cown address\u00e2\u0080\u009d. (gui#740)\n\n\nThe ability to create legacy wallets is being removed. (gui#764)\n\n\nContrib\n\nBash completion files have been renamed from bitcoin*.bash-completion to\nbitcoin*.bash. This means completions can be automatically loaded on demand\nbased on invoked commands\u00e2\u0080\u0099 names when they are put into the completion\ndirectory (found with pkg-config --variable=completionsdir\nbash-completion) without requiring renaming. (#28507)\n\nLow-level changes\nTests\n\nNon-standard transactions are now disabled by default on testnet\nfor relay and mempool acceptance. The previous behaviour can be\nre-enabled by setting -acceptnonstdtxn=1.

Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt</code> (on macOS)\nor <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoind</code>/<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin-qt</code> (on Linux).</p>\n<p>Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\npossible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\nwallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.</p>\n<h1 id=\"compatibility\">Compatibility</h1>\n<p>Bitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\nusing the Linux kernel, macOS 11.0+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Bitcoin\nCore should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\nfrequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\nunsupported systems.</p>\n<h1 id=\"notable-changes\">Notable changes</h1>\n<h2 id=\"p2p-and-network-changes\">P2P and network changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Experimental support for the v2 transport protocol defined in\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0324.mediawiki\">BIP324</a> was added.\nIt is off by default, but when enabled using <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-v2transport</code> it will be negotiated\non a per-connection basis with other peers that support it too. The existing\nv1 transport protocol remains fully supported.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Nodes with multiple reachable networks will actively try to have at least one\noutbound connection to each network. This improves individual resistance to\neclipse attacks and network level resistance to partition attacks. Users no\nlonger need to perform active measures to ensure being connected to multiple\nenabled networks. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27213\">#27213</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"pruning\">Pruning</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>When using assumeutxo with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-prune</code>, the prune budget may be exceeded if it is set\nlower than 1100MB (i.e. <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">MIN_DISK_SPACE_FOR_BLOCK_FILES * 2</code>). Prune budget is normally\nsplit evenly across each chainstate, unless the resulting prune budget per chainstate\nis beneath <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">MIN_DISK_SPACE_FOR_BLOCK_FILES</code> in which case that value will be used. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27596\">#27596</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"updated-rpcs\">Updated RPCs</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Setting <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-rpcserialversion=0</code> is deprecated and will be removed in\na future release. It can currently still be used by also adding\nthe <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-deprecatedrpc=serialversion</code> option. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28448\">#28448</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">hash_serialized_2</code> value has been removed from <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">gettxoutsetinfo</code> since the value it\ncalculated contained a bug and did not take all data into account. It is superseded by\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">hash_serialized_3</code> which provides the same functionality but serves the correctly calculated hash. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28685\">#28685</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>New fields <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">transport_protocol_type</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">session_id</code> were added to the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getpeerinfo</code> RPC to indicate\nwhether the v2 transport protocol is in use, and if so, what the session id is.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A new argument <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">v2transport</code> was added to the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">addnode</code> RPC to indicate whether a v2 transaction connection\nis to be attempted with the peer.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/\">Miniscript</a> expressions can now be used in Taproot descriptors for all RPCs working with descriptors. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27255\">#27255</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">finalizepsbt</code> is now able to finalize a PSBT with inputs spending <a href=\"https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/\">Miniscript</a>-compatible Taproot leaves. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27255\">#27255</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Changes to wallet related RPCs can be found in the Wallet section below.</p>\n<h2 id=\"new-rpcs\">New RPCs</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">loadtxoutset</code> has been added, which allows loading a UTXO snapshot of the format\ngenerated by <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">dumptxoutset</code>. Once this snapshot is loaded, its contents will be\ndeserialized into a second chainstate data structure, which is then used to sync to\nthe network\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tip.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the original chainstate will complete the initial block download process in\nthe background, eventually validating up to the block that the snapshot is based upon.</p>\n<p>The result is a usable bitcoind instance that is current with the network tip in a\nmatter of minutes rather than hours. UTXO snapshot are typically obtained via\nthird-party sources (HTTP, torrent, etc.) which is reasonable since their contents\nare always checked by hash.</p>\n<p>You can find more information on this process in the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">assumeutxo</code> design\ndocument (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/design/assumeutxo.md\">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/design/assumeutxo.md</a>).</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getchainstates</code> has been added to aid in monitoring the assumeutxo sync process.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A new <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getprioritisedtransactions</code> RPC has been added. It returns a map of all fee deltas created by the\nuser with prioritisetransaction, indexed by txid. The map also indicates whether each transaction is\npresent in the mempool. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27501\">#27501</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A new RPC, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">submitpackage</code>, has been added. It can be used to submit a list of raw hex\ntransactions to the mempool to be evaluated as a package using consensus and mempool policy rules.\nThese policies include package CPFP, allowing a child with high fees to bump a parent below the\nmempool minimum feerate (but not minimum relay feerate). (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27609\">#27609</a>)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Warning: successful submission does not mean the transactions will propagate throughout the\nnetwork, as package relay is not supported.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Not all features are available. The package is limited to a child with all of its\nunconfirmed parents, and no parent may spend the output of another parent.  Also, package\nRBF is not supported. Refer to doc/policy/packages.md for more details on package policies\nand limitations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This RPC is experimental. Its interface may change.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A new RPC <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getaddrmaninfo</code> has been added to view the distribution of addresses in the new and tried table of the\nnode\u00e2\u0080\u0099s address manager across different networks(ipv4, ipv6, onion, i2p, cjdns). The RPC returns count of addresses\nin new and tried table as well as their sum for all networks. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27511\">#27511</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A new <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">importmempool</code> RPC has been added. It loads a valid <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">mempool.dat</code> file and attempts to\nadd its contents to the mempool. This can be useful to import mempool data from another node\nwithout having to modify the datadir contents and without having to restart the node. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27460\">#27460</a>)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Warning: Importing untrusted files is dangerous, especially if metadata from the file is taken over.</li>\n<li>If you want to apply fee deltas, it is recommended to use the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getprioritisedtransactions</code> and\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">prioritisetransaction</code> RPCs instead of the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">apply_fee_delta_priority</code> option to avoid\ndouble-prioritising any already-prioritised transactions in the mempool.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"updated-settings\">Updated settings</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoind</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin-qt</code> will now raise an error on startup\n if a datadir that is being used contains a bitcoin.conf file that\n will be ignored, which can happen when a datadir= line is used in\n a bitcoin.conf file. The error message is just a diagnostic intended\n to prevent accidental misconfiguration, and it can be disabled to\n restore the previous behavior of using the datadir while ignoring\n the bitcoin.conf contained in it. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27302\">#27302</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Passing an invalid <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-debug</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-debugexclude</code>, or <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-loglevel</code> logging configuration\noption now raises an error, rather than logging an easily missed warning. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27632\">#27632</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Changes to GUI or wallet related settings can be found in the GUI or Wallet section below.</p>\n<h2 id=\"new-settings\">New settings</h2>\n<h2 id=\"tools-and-utilities\">Tools and Utilities</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A new <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoinconsensus_verify_script_with_spent_outputs</code> function is available in libconsensus which optionally accepts the spent outputs of the transaction being verified.</li>\n<li>A new <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoinconsensus_SCRIPT_FLAGS_VERIFY_TAPROOT</code> flag is available in libconsensus that will verify scripts with the Taproot spending rules.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"wallet\">Wallet</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Wallet loading has changed in this release. Wallets with some corrupted records that could be\npreviously loaded (with warnings) may no longer load. For example, wallets with corrupted\naddress book entries may no longer load. If this happens, it is recommended\nload the wallet in a previous version of Bitcoin Core and import the data into a new wallet.\nPlease also report an issue to help improve the software and make wallet loading more robust\nin these cases. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24914\">#24914</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">createwallet</code> RPC will no longer create legacy (BDB) wallets when\nsetting <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">descriptors=false</code> without also providing the\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-deprecatedrpc=create_bdb</code> option. This is because the legacy wallet is\nbeing deprecated in a future release. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28597\">#28597</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">gettransaction</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">listtransactions</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">listsinceblock</code> RPCs now return\nthe <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">abandoned</code> field for all transactions. Previously, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cabandoned\u00e2\u0080\u009d field\nwas only returned for sent transactions. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25158\">#25158</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">listdescriptors</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">decodepsbt</code> and similar RPC methods now show <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">h</code> rather than apostrophe (<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">'</code>) to indicate\nhardened derivation. This does not apply when using the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">private</code> parameter, which\nmatches the marker used when descriptor was generated or imported. Newly created\nwallets use <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">h</code>. This change makes it easier to handle descriptor strings manually.\nE.g. the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">importdescriptors</code> RPC call is easiest to use <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">h</code> as the marker: <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">'[\"desc\": \".../0h/...\"]'</code>.\nWith this change <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">listdescriptors</code> will use <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">h</code>, so you can copy-paste the result,\nwithout having to add escape characters or switch <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">'</code> to \u00e2\u0080\u0098h\u00e2\u0080\u0099 manually.\nNote that this changes the descriptor checksum.\nFor legacy wallets the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">hdkeypath</code> field in <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getaddressinfo</code> is unchanged,\nnor is the serialization format of wallet dumps. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26076\">#26076</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getbalances</code> RPC now returns a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">lastprocessedblock</code> JSON object which contains the wallet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s last processed block\nhash and height at the time the balances were calculated. This result shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be cached because importing new keys could invalidate it. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26094\">#26094</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">gettransaction</code> RPC now returns a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">lastprocessedblock</code> JSON object which contains the wallet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s last processed block\nhash and height at the time the transaction information was generated. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26094\">#26094</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getwalletinfo</code> RPC now returns a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">lastprocessedblock</code> JSON object which contains the wallet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s last processed block\nhash and height at the time the wallet information was generated.

It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\nunsupported systems.\nNotable changes\nP2P and network changes\n\nTransactions of non-witness size 65 bytes and above are now allowed by mempool\nand relay policy. This is to better reflect the actual afforded protections\nagainst CVE-2017-12842 and open up additional use-cases of smaller transaction sizes. (#26265)\n\nNew RPCs\n\nThe scanblocks RPC returns the relevant blockhashes from a set of descriptors by\nscanning all blockfilters in the given range. It can be used in combination with\nthe getblockheader and rescanblockchain RPCs to achieve fast wallet rescans. Note\nthat this functionality can only be used if a compact block filter index\n(-blockfilterindex=1) has been constructed by the node. (#23549)\n\nUpdated RPCs\n\nAll JSON-RPC methods accept a new named\nparameter called args that can\ncontain positional parameter values. This is a convenience to allow some\nparameter values to be passed by name without having to name every value. The\npython test framework and bitcoin-cli tool both take advantage of this, so\nfor example:\n\nbitcoin-cli -named createwallet wallet_name=mywallet load_on_startup=1\n\nCan now be shortened to:\nbitcoin-cli -named createwallet mywallet load_on_startup=1\n\n\n\nThe verifychain RPC will now return false if the checks didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fail,\nbut couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be completed at the desired depth and level. This could be due\nto missing data while pruning, due to an insufficient dbcache or due to\nthe node being shutdown before the call could finish. (#25574)\n\n\nsendrawtransaction has a new, optional argument, maxburnamount with a default value of 0.\nAny transaction containing an unspendable output with a value greater than maxburnamount will\nnot be submitted. At present, the outputs deemed unspendable are those with scripts that begin\nwith an OP_RETURN code (known as \u00e2\u0080\u0098datacarriers\u00e2\u0080\u0099), scripts that exceed the maximum script size,\nand scripts that contain invalid opcodes.\n\n\nThe testmempoolaccept RPC now returns 2 additional results within the \u00e2\u0080\u009cfees\u00e2\u0080\u009d result:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009ceffective-feerate\u00e2\u0080\u009d is the feerate including fees and sizes of transactions validated together if\npackage validation was used, and also includes any modified fees from prioritisetransaction. The\n\u00e2\u0080\u009ceffective-includes\u00e2\u0080\u009d result lists the wtxids of transactions whose modified fees and sizes were used\nin the effective-feerate (#26646).\n\n\ndecodescript may now infer a Miniscript descriptor under P2WSH context if it is not lacking\ninformation. (#27037)\n\n\nfinalizepsbt is now able to finalize a transaction with inputs spending Miniscript-compatible\nP2WSH scripts. (#24149)\n\n\nChanges to wallet related RPCs can be found in the Wallet section below.\nBuild System\n\nThe --enable-upnp-default and --enable-natpmp-default options\nhave been removed. If you want to use port mapping, you can\nconfigure it using a .conf file, or by passing the relevant\noptions at runtime. (#26896)\n\nUpdated settings\n\n\nIf the -checkblocks or -checklevel options are explicitly provided by the\nuser, but the verification checks cannot be completed due to an insufficient\ndbcache, Bitcoin Core will now return an error at startup. (#25574)\n\n\nPorts specified in -port and -rpcport options are now validated at startup.\nValues that previously worked and were considered valid can now result in errors. (#22087)\n\n\nSetting -blocksonly will now reduce the maximum mempool memory\nto 5MB (users may still use -maxmempool to override). Previously,\nthe default 300MB would be used, leading to unexpected memory usage\nfor users running with -blocksonly expecting it to eliminate\nmempool memory usage.\nAs unused mempool memory is shared with dbcache, this also reduces\nthe dbcache size for users running with -blocksonly, potentially\nimpacting performance.\n\n\nSetting -maxconnections=0 will now disable -dnsseed\nand -listen (users may still set them to override).\n\n\nChanges to GUI or wallet related settings can be found in the GUI or Wallet section below.\nNew settings\n\nThe shutdownnotify option is used to specify a command to execute synchronously\nbefore Bitcoin Core has begun its shutdown sequence. (#23395)\n\nWallet\n\nThe minconf option, which allows a user to specify the minimum number\nof confirmations a UTXO being spent has, and the maxconf option,\nwhich allows specifying the maximum number of confirmations, have been\nadded to the following RPCs in #25375:\n    \nfundrawtransaction\nsend\nwalletcreatefundedpsbt\nsendall\n\n\n\nAdded a new next_index field in the response in listdescriptors to\nhave the same format as importdescriptors (#26194)\n\n\nRPC listunspent now has a new argument include_immature_coinbase\nto include coinbase UTXOs that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t meet the minimum spendability\ndepth requirement (which before were silently skipped). (#25730)\n\n\nRescans for descriptor wallets are now significantly faster if compact\nblock filters (BIP158) are available. Since those are not constructed\nby default, the configuration option \u00e2\u0080\u009c-blockfilterindex=1\u00e2\u0080\u009d has to be\nprovided to take advantage of the optimization. This improves the\nperformance of the RPC calls rescanblockchain, importdescriptors\nand restorewallet. (#25957)\n\n\nRPC unloadwallet now fails if a rescan is in progress. (#26618)\n\n\nWallet passphrases may now contain null characters.\nPrior to this change, only characters up to the first\nnull character were recognized and accepted. (#27068)\n\n\nAddress Purposes strings are now restricted to the currently known values of \u00e2\u0080\u009csend\u00e2\u0080\u009d,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009creceive\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and \u00e2\u0080\u009crefund\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Wallets that have unrecognized purpose strings will have\nloading warnings, and the listlabels RPC will raise an error if an unrecognized purpose\nis requested. (#27217)\n\n\nIn the createwallet, loadwallet, unloadwallet, and restorewallet RPCs, the\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cwarning\u00e2\u0080\u009d string field is deprecated in favor of a \u00e2\u0080\u009cwarnings\u00e2\u0080\u009d field that\nreturns a JSON array of strings to better handle multiple warning messages and\nfor consistency with other wallet RPCs. The \u00e2\u0080\u009cwarning\u00e2\u0080\u009d field will be fully\nremoved from these RPCs in v26. It can be temporarily re-enabled during the\ndeprecation period by launching bitcoind with the configuration option\n-deprecatedrpc=walletwarningfield. (#27279)\n\nDescriptor wallets can now spend coins sent to P2WSH Miniscript descriptors. (#24149)\n\nGUI changes\n\nThe \u00e2\u0080\u009cMask values\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a persistent option now. (gui#701)\nThe \u00e2\u0080\u009cMask values\u00e2\u0080\u009d option affects the \u00e2\u0080\u009cTransaction\u00e2\u0080\u009d view now, in addition to the\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOverview\u00e2\u0080\u009d one. (gui#708)\n\nREST\n\nA new /rest/deploymentinfo endpoint has been added for fetching various\nstate info regarding deployments of consensus changes. (#25412)\n\nBinary verification\n\nThe binary verification script has been updated. In previous releases it\nwould verify that the binaries had been signed with a single \u00e2\u0080\u009crelease key\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\nIn this release and moving forward it will verify that the binaries are\nsigned by a threshold of trusted keys. For more details and\nexamples, see:\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/contrib/verify-binaries/README.md\n(#27358)\n\nLow-level changes\nRPC\n\nThe JSON-RPC server now rejects requests where a parameter is specified multiple\ntimes with the same name, instead of silently overwriting earlier parameter values\nwith later ones. (#26628)\nRPC listsinceblock now accepts an optional label argument\nto fetch incoming transactions having the specified label. (#25934)\nPreviously setban, addpeeraddress, walletcreatefundedpsbt, methods\nallowed non-boolean and non-null values to be passed as boolean parameters.\nAny string, number, array, or object value that was passed would be treated\nas false. After this change, passing any value except true, false, or\nnull now triggers a JSON value is not of expected type error.

Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on macOS)\nor bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).\nUpgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\npossible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\nwallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\nCompatibility\nBitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\nusing the Linux kernel, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer.

Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on macOS)\nor bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).\nUpgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\npossible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\nwallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\nCompatibility\nBitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\nusing the Linux kernel, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Bitcoin\nCore should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\nfrequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\nunsupported systems.\nNotice of new option for transaction replacement policies\nThis version of Bitcoin Core adds a new mempoolfullrbf configuration\noption which allows users to change the policy their individual node\nwill use for relaying and mining unconfirmed transactions.  The option\ndefaults to the same policy that was used in previous releases and no\nchanges to node policy will occur if everyone uses the default.\nSome Bitcoin services today expect that the first version of an\nunconfirmed transaction that they see will be the version of the\ntransaction that ultimately gets confirmed\u00e2\u0080\u0094a transaction acceptance\npolicy sometimes called \u00e2\u0080\u009cfirst-seen\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\nThe Bitcoin Protocol does not, and cannot, provide any assurance that\nthe first version of an unconfirmed transaction seen by a particular\nnode will be the version that gets confirmed.  If there are multiple\nversions of the same unconfirmed transaction available, only the miner\nwho includes one of those transactions in a block gets to decide which\nversion of the transaction gets confirmed.\nDespite this lack of assurance, multiple merchants and services today\nstill make this assumption.\nThere are several benefits to users from removing this first-seen\nsimplification.  One key benefit, the ability for the sender of a\ntransaction to replace it with an alternative version paying higher\nfees, was realized in Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 (February 2016) with the\nintroduction of BIP125 opt-in Replace By Fee (RBF).\nSince then, there has been discussion about completely removing the\nfirst-seen simplification and allowing users to replace any of their\nolder unconfirmed transactions with newer transactions, a feature called\nfull-RBF.  This release includes a mempoolfullrbf configuration\noption that allows enabling full-RBF, although it defaults to off\n(allowing only opt-in RBF).\nSeveral alternative node implementations have already enabled full-RBF by\ndefault for years, and several contributors to Bitcoin Core are\nadvocating for enabling full-RBF by default in a future version of\nBitcoin Core.\nAs more nodes that participate in relay and mining begin enabling\nfull-RBF, replacement of unconfirmed transactions by ones offering higher\nfees may rapidly become more reliable.\nContributors to this project strongly recommend that merchants and services\nnot accept unconfirmed transactions as final, and if they insist on doing so,\nto take the appropriate steps to ensure they have some recourse or plan for\nwhen their assumptions do not hold.\nNotable changes\nP2P and network changes\n\n\nTo address a potential denial-of-service, the logic to download headers from peers\nhas been reworked.  This is particularly relevant for nodes starting up for the\nfirst time (or for nodes which are starting up after being offline for a long time).\nWhenever headers are received from a peer that have a total chainwork that is either\nless than the node\u00e2\u0080\u0099s -minimumchainwork value or is sufficiently below the work at\nthe node\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tip, a \u00e2\u0080\u009cpresync\u00e2\u0080\u009d phase will begin, in which the node will download the\npeer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s headers and verify the cumulative work on the peer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chain, prior to storing\nthose headers permanently. Once that cumulative work is verified to be sufficiently high,\nthe headers will be redownloaded from that peer and fully validated and stored.\nThis may result in initial headers sync taking longer for new nodes starting up for\nthe first time, both because the headers will be downloaded twice, and because the effect\nof a peer disconnecting during the presync phase (or while the node\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best headers chain has less\nthan -minimumchainwork), will result in the node needing to use the headers presync mechanism\nwith the next peer as well (downloading the headers twice, again). (#25717)\n\n\nWith I2P connections, a new, transient address is used for each outbound\nconnection if -i2pacceptincoming=0. (#25355)\n\n\nUpdated RPCs\n\n\nThe -deprecatedrpc=softforks configuration option has been removed.  The\nRPC getblockchaininfo no longer returns the softforks field, which was\npreviously deprecated in 23.0. (#23508) Information on soft fork status is\nnow only available via the getdeploymentinfo RPC.\n\n\nThe deprecatedrpc=exclude_coinbase configuration option has been removed.\nThe receivedby RPCs (listreceivedbyaddress, listreceivedbylabel,\ngetreceivedbyaddress and getreceivedbylabel) now always return results\naccounting for received coins from coinbase outputs, without an option to\nchange that behaviour. Excluding coinbases was previously deprecated in 23.0.\n(#25171)\n\n\nThe deprecatedrpc=fees configuration option has been removed. The top-level\nfee fields fee, modifiedfee, ancestorfees and descendantfees are no\nlonger returned by RPCs getmempoolentry, getrawmempool(verbose=true),\ngetmempoolancestors(verbose=true) and getmempooldescendants(verbose=true).\nThe same fee fields can be accessed through the fees object in the result.\nThe top-level fee fields were previously deprecated in 23.0. (#25204)\n\n\nThe getpeerinfo RPC has been updated with a new presynced_headers field,\nindicating the progress on the presync phase mentioned in the\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cP2P and network changes\u00e2\u0080\u009d section above.\n\n\nChanges to wallet related RPCs can be found in the Wallet section below.\nNew RPCs\n\n\nThe sendall RPC spends specific UTXOs to one or more recipients\nwithout creating change. By default, the sendall RPC will spend\nevery UTXO in the wallet. sendall is useful to empty wallets or to\ncreate a changeless payment from select UTXOs. When creating a payment\nfrom a specific amount for which the recipient incurs the transaction\nfee, continue to use the subtractfeefromamount option via the\nsend, sendtoaddress, or sendmany RPCs. (#24118)\n\n\nA new gettxspendingprevout RPC has been added, which scans the mempool to find\ntransactions spending any of the given outpoints. (#24408)\n\n\nThe simulaterawtransaction RPC iterates over the inputs and outputs of the given\ntransactions, and tallies up the balance change for the given wallet. This can be\nuseful e.g. when verifying that a coin join like transaction doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t contain unexpected\ninputs that the wallet will then sign for unintentionally. (#22751)\n\n\nUpdated REST APIs\n\n\nThe /headers/ and /blockfilterheaders/ endpoints have been updated to use\na query parameter instead of path parameter to specify the result count. The\ncount parameter is now optional, and defaults to 5 for both endpoints. The old\nendpoints are still functional, and have no documented behaviour change.\nFor /headers, use\nGET /rest/headers/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>?count=<COUNT=5>\ninstead of\nGET /rest/headers/<COUNT>/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json> (deprecated)\nFor /blockfilterheaders/, use\nGET /rest/blockfilterheaders/<FILTERTYPE>/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>?count=<COUNT=5>\ninstead of\nGET /rest/blockfilterheaders/<FILTERTYPE>/<COUNT>/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json> (deprecated)\n(#24098)\n\n\nBuild System\n\nGuix builds are now reproducible across architectures (x86_64 & aarch64). (#21194)\n\nNew settings\n\nA new mempoolfullrbf option has been added, which enables the mempool to\naccept transaction replacement without enforcing BIP125 replaceability\nsignaling. (#25353)\n\nWallet\n\n\nThe -walletrbf startup option will now default to true. The\nwallet will now default to opt-in RBF on transactions that it creates. (#25610)\n\n\nThe replaceable option for the createrawtransaction and\ncreatepsbt RPCs will now default to true. Transactions created\nwith these RPCs will default to having opt-in RBF enabled. (#25610)\n\n\nThe wsh() output descriptor was extended with Miniscript support. You can import Miniscript\ndescriptors for P2WSH in a watchonly wallet to track coins, but you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t spend from them using\nthe Bitcoin Core wallet yet.\nYou can find more about Miniscript on the reference website. (#24148)\n\n\nThe tr() output descriptor now supports multisig scripts through the multi_a() and\nsortedmulti_a() functions. (#24043)\n\n\nTo help prevent fingerprinting transactions created by the Bitcoin Core wallet, change output\namounts are now randomized. (#24494)\n\n\nThe listtransactions, gettransaction, and listsinceblock\nRPC methods now include a wtxid field (hash of serialized transaction,\nincluding witness data) for each transaction. (#24198)\n\n\nThe listsinceblock, listtransactions and gettransaction output now contain a new\nparent_descs field for every \u00e2\u0080\u009creceive\u00e2\u0080\u009d entry. (#25504)\n\n\nA new optional include_change parameter was added to the listsinceblock command.\n\n\nRPC getreceivedbylabel now returns an error, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLabel not found\nin wallet\u00e2\u0080\u009d (-4), if the label is not in the address book. (#25122)\n\n\nMigrating Legacy Wallets to Descriptor Wallets\nAn experimental RPC migratewallet has been added to migrate Legacy (non-descriptor) wallets to\nDescriptor wallets. More information about the migration process is available in the\ndocumentation.\nGUI changes\n\n\nA new menu item to restore a wallet from a backup file has been added (gui#471).\n\n\nConfiguration changes made in the bitcoin GUI (such as the pruning setting,\nproxy settings, UPNP preferences) are now saved to <datadir>/settings.json\nfile rather than to the Qt settings backend (windows registry or unix desktop\nconfig files), so these settings will now apply to bitcoind, instead of being\nignored. (#15936, gui#602)\n\n\nAlso, the interaction between GUI settings and bitcoin.conf settings is\nsimplified. Settings from bitcoin.conf are now displayed normally in the GUI\nsettings dialog, instead of in a separate warning message (\u00e2\u0080\u009cOptions set in this\ndialog are overridden by the configuration file: -setting=value\u00e2\u0080\u009d). And these\nsettings can now be edited because settings.json values take precedence over\nbitcoin.conf values.

Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt</code> (on macOS)\nor <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoind</code>/<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin-qt</code> (on Linux).</p>\n<p>Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\npossible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\nwallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.</p>\n<h1 id=\"compatibility\">Compatibility</h1>\n<p>Bitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\nusing the Linux kernel, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Bitcoin\nCore should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\nfrequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\nunsupported systems.</p>\n<h1 id=\"notice-of-new-option-for-transaction-replacement-policies\">Notice of new option for transaction replacement policies</h1>\n<p>This version of Bitcoin Core adds a new <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">mempoolfullrbf</code> configuration\noption which allows users to change the policy their individual node\nwill use for relaying and mining unconfirmed transactions.  The option\ndefaults to the same policy that was used in previous releases and no\nchanges to node policy will occur if everyone uses the default.</p>\n<p>Some Bitcoin services today expect that the first version of an\nunconfirmed transaction that they see will be the version of the\ntransaction that ultimately gets confirmed\u00e2\u0080\u0094a transaction acceptance\npolicy sometimes called \u00e2\u0080\u009cfirst-seen\u00e2\u0080\u009d.</p>\n<p>The Bitcoin Protocol does not, and cannot, provide any assurance that\nthe first version of an unconfirmed transaction seen by a particular\nnode will be the version that gets confirmed.  If there are multiple\nversions of the same unconfirmed transaction available, only the miner\nwho includes one of those transactions in a block gets to decide which\nversion of the transaction gets confirmed.</p>\n<p>Despite this lack of assurance, multiple merchants and services today\nstill make this assumption.</p>\n<p>There are several benefits to users from removing this <em>first-seen</em>\nsimplification.  One key benefit, the ability for the sender of a\ntransaction to replace it with an alternative version paying higher\nfees, was realized in <a href=\"https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/0.12.0/#opt-in-replace-by-fee-transactions\">Bitcoin Core 0.12.0</a> (February 2016) with the\nintroduction of <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki\">BIP125</a> opt-in Replace By Fee (RBF).</p>\n<p>Since then, there has been discussion about completely removing the\nfirst-seen simplification and allowing users to replace any of their\nolder unconfirmed transactions with newer transactions, a feature called\n<em>full-RBF</em>.  This release includes a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">mempoolfullrbf</code> configuration\noption that allows enabling full-RBF, although it defaults to off\n(allowing only opt-in RBF).</p>\n<p>Several alternative node implementations have already enabled full-RBF by\ndefault for years, and several contributors to Bitcoin Core are\nadvocating for enabling full-RBF by default in a future version of\nBitcoin Core.</p>\n<p>As more nodes that participate in relay and mining begin enabling\nfull-RBF, replacement of unconfirmed transactions by ones offering higher\nfees may rapidly become more reliable.</p>\n<p>Contributors to this project strongly recommend that merchants and services\nnot accept unconfirmed transactions as final, and if they insist on doing so,\nto take the appropriate steps to ensure they have some recourse or plan for\nwhen their assumptions do not hold.</p>\n<h1 id=\"notable-changes\">Notable changes</h1>\n<h2 id=\"p2p-and-network-changes\">P2P and network changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>To address a potential denial-of-service, the logic to download headers from peers\nhas been reworked.  This is particularly relevant for nodes starting up for the\nfirst time (or for nodes which are starting up after being offline for a long time).</p>\n<p>Whenever headers are received from a peer that have a total chainwork that is either\nless than the node\u00e2\u0080\u0099s <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-minimumchainwork</code> value or is sufficiently below the work at\nthe node\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tip, a \u00e2\u0080\u009cpresync\u00e2\u0080\u009d phase will begin, in which the node will download the\npeer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s headers and verify the cumulative work on the peer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chain, prior to storing\nthose headers permanently. Once that cumulative work is verified to be sufficiently high,\nthe headers will be redownloaded from that peer and fully validated and stored.</p>\n<p>This may result in initial headers sync taking longer for new nodes starting up for\nthe first time, both because the headers will be downloaded twice, and because the effect\nof a peer disconnecting during the presync phase (or while the node\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best headers chain has less\nthan <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-minimumchainwork</code>), will result in the node needing to use the headers presync mechanism\nwith the next peer as well (downloading the headers twice, again).

Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac)\nor bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).\nUpgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\npossible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\nwallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\nCompatibility\nBitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\nusing the Linux kernel, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Bitcoin\nCore should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\nfrequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\nunsupported systems.\nNotable changes\nP2P and network changes\n\n\nA bitcoind node will no longer rumour addresses to inbound peers by default.\nThey will become eligible for address gossip after sending an ADDR, ADDRV2,\nor GETADDR message. (#21528)\n\n\nBefore this release, Bitcoin Core had a strong preference to try to connect only to peers that listen on port 8333. As a result of that, Bitcoin nodes listening on non-standard ports would likely not get any Bitcoin Core peers connecting to them. This preference has been removed. (#23542)\n\n\nFull support has been added for the CJDNS network. See the new option -cjdnsreachable and doc/cjdns.md (#23077)\n\n\nFee estimation changes\n\nFee estimation now takes the feerate of replacement (RBF) transactions into\naccount. (#22539)\n\nRescan startup parameter removed\nThe -rescan startup parameter has been removed. Wallets which require\nrescanning due to corruption will still be rescanned on startup.\nOtherwise, please use the rescanblockchain RPC to trigger a rescan. (#23123)\nTracepoints and Userspace, Statically Defined Tracing support\nBitcoin Core release binaries for Linux now include experimental tracepoints which\nact as an interface for process-internal events. These can be used for review,\ndebugging, monitoring, and more. The tracepoint API is semi-stable. While the API\nis tested, process internals might change between releases requiring changes to the\ntracepoints. Information about the existing tracepoints can be found under\ndoc/tracing.md and\nusage examples are provided in contrib/tracing/.\nUpdated RPCs\n\n\nThe validateaddress RPC now returns an error_locations array for invalid\naddresses, with the indices of invalid character locations in the address (if\nknown). For example, this will attempt to locate up to two Bech32 errors, and\nreturn their locations if successful. Success and correctness are only guaranteed\nif fewer than two substitution errors have been made.\nThe error message returned in the error field now also returns more specific\nerrors when decoding fails. (#16807)\n\nThe -deprecatedrpc=addresses configuration option has been removed.  RPCs\ngettxout, getrawtransaction, decoderawtransaction, decodescript,\ngettransaction verbose=true and REST endpoints /rest/tx, /rest/getutxos,\n/rest/block no longer return the addresses and reqSigs fields, which\nwere previously deprecated in 22.0. (#22650)\nThe getblock RPC command now supports verbosity level 3 containing transaction inputs\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nprevout information.  The existing /rest/block/ REST endpoint is modified to contain\nthis information too. Every vin field will contain an additional prevout subfield\ndescribing the spent output. prevout contains the following keys:\n    \ngenerated - true if the spent coins was a coinbase.\nheight\nvalue\nscriptPubKey\n\n\n\nThe top-level fee fields fee, modifiedfee, ancestorfees and descendantfees\nreturned by RPCs getmempoolentry,getrawmempool(verbose=true),\ngetmempoolancestors(verbose=true) and getmempooldescendants(verbose=true)\nare deprecated and will be removed in the next major version (use\n-deprecated=fees if needed in this version). The same fee fields can be accessed\nthrough the fees object in the result. WARNING: deprecated\nfields ancestorfees and descendantfees are denominated in sats, whereas all\nfields in the fees object are denominated in BTC. (#22689)\n\nBoth createmultisig and addmultisigaddress now include a warnings\nfield, which will show a warning if a non-legacy address type is requested\nwhen using uncompressed public keys. (#23113)\n\nChanges to wallet related RPCs can be found in the Wallet section below.\nNew RPCs\n\nInformation on soft fork status has been moved from getblockchaininfo\nto the new getdeploymentinfo RPC which allows querying soft fork status at any\nblock, rather than just at the chain tip. Inclusion of soft fork\nstatus in getblockchaininfo can currently be restored using the\nconfiguration -deprecatedrpc=softforks, but this will be removed in\na future release. Note that in either case, the status field\nnow reflects the status of the current block rather than the next\nblock. (#23508)\n\nFiles\n\nOn startup, the list of banned hosts and networks (via setban RPC) in\nbanlist.dat is ignored and only banlist.json is considered. Bitcoin Core\nversion 22.x is the only version that can read banlist.dat and also write\nit to banlist.json. If banlist.json already exists, version 22.x will not\ntry to translate the banlist.dat into json. After an upgrade, listbanned\ncan be used to double check the parsed entries. (#22570)\n\nUpdated settings\n\n\nIn previous releases, the meaning of the command line option\n-persistmempool (without a value provided) incorrectly disabled mempool\npersistence.  -persistmempool is now treated like other boolean options to\nmean -persistmempool=1. Passing -persistmempool=0, -persistmempool=1\nand -nopersistmempool is unaffected. (#23061)\n\n\n-maxuploadtarget now allows human readable byte units [k|K|m|M|g|G|t|T].\nE.g. -maxuploadtarget=500g. No whitespace, +- or fractions allowed.\nDefault is M if no suffix provided. (#23249)\n\n\nIf -proxy= is given together with -noonion then the provided proxy will\nnot be set as a proxy for reaching the Tor network. So it will not be\npossible to open manual connections to the Tor network for example with the\naddnode RPC. To mimic the old behavior use -proxy= together with\n-onlynet= listing all relevant networks except onion. (#22834)\n\n\nTools and Utilities\n\n\nUpdate -getinfo to return data in a user-friendly format that also reduces vertical space. (#21832)\n\n\nCLI -addrinfo now returns a single field for the number of onion addresses\nknown to the node instead of separate torv2 and torv3 fields, as support\nfor Tor V2 addresses was removed from Bitcoin Core in 22.0. (#22544)\n\n\nWallet\n\n\nDescriptor wallets are now the default wallet type. Newly created wallets\nwill use descriptors unless descriptors=false is set during createwallet, or\nthe Descriptor wallet checkbox is unchecked in the GUI.\nNote that wallet RPC commands like importmulti and dumpprivkey cannot be\nused with descriptor wallets, so if your client code relies on these commands\nwithout specifying descriptors=false during wallet creation, you will need\nto update your code.\n\n\nNewly created descriptor wallets will contain an automatically generated tr()\ndescriptor which allows for creating single key Taproot receiving addresses.\n\n\nupgradewallet will now automatically flush the keypool if upgrading\nfrom a non-HD wallet to an HD wallet, to immediately start using the\nnewly-generated HD keys. (#23093)\n\n\na new RPC newkeypool has been added, which will flush (entirely\nclear and refill) the keypool. (#23093)\n\n\nlistunspent now includes ancestorcount, ancestorsize, and\nancestorfees for each transaction output that is still in the mempool.\n(#12677)\n\n\nlockunspent now optionally takes a third parameter, persistent, which\ncauses the lock to be written persistently to the wallet database. This\nallows UTXOs to remain locked even after node restarts or crashes. (#23065)\n\n\nreceivedby RPCs now include coinbase transactions. Previously, the\nfollowing wallet RPCs excluded coinbase transactions: getreceivedbyaddress,\ngetreceivedbylabel, listreceivedbyaddress, listreceivedbylabel. This\nrelease changes this behaviour and returns results accounting for received\ncoins from coinbase outputs. The previous behaviour can be restored using the\nconfiguration -deprecatedrpc=exclude_coinbase, but may be removed in a\nfuture release. (#14707)\n\n\nA new option in the same receivedby RPCs, include_immature_coinbase\n(default=false), determines whether to account for immature coinbase\ntransactions. Immature coinbase transactions are coinbase transactions that\nhave 100 or fewer confirmations, and are not spendable. (#14707)\n\n\nGUI changes\n\n\nUTXOs which are locked via the GUI are now stored persistently in the\nwallet database, so are not lost on node shutdown or crash. (#23065)\n\n\nThe Bech32 checkbox has been replaced with a dropdown for all address types, including the new Bech32m (BIP-350) standard for Taproot enabled wallets.\n\n\nLow-level changes\nRPC\n\ngetblockchaininfo now returns a new time field, that provides the chain tip time. (#22407)\n\nTests\n\nFor the regtest network the activation heights of several softforks were\nset to block height 1. They can be changed by the runtime setting\n-testactivationheight=name@height.

Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on macOS)\nor bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).\nUpgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\npossible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\nwallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\nCompatibility\nBitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\nusing the Linux kernel, macOS 10.14+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Bitcoin\nCore should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\nfrequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\nunsupported systems.\nFrom Bitcoin Core 22.0 onwards, macOS versions earlier than 10.14 are no longer supported.\nNotable changes\nUpdated settings\n\nIn previous releases, the meaning of the command line option\n-persistmempool (without a value provided) incorrectly disabled mempool\npersistence.  -persistmempool is now treated like other boolean options to\nmean -persistmempool=1. Passing -persistmempool=0, -persistmempool=1\nand -nopersistmempool is unaffected.

Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac)\nor bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).\nUpgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\npossible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\nwallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\nCompatibility\nBitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\nusing the Linux kernel, macOS 10.14+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Bitcoin\nCore should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\nfrequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\nunsupported systems.\nFrom Bitcoin Core 22.0 onwards, macOS versions earlier than 10.14 are no longer supported.\nNotable changes\nP2P and network changes\n\nAdded support for running Bitcoin Core as an\nI2P (Invisible Internet Project) service\nand connect to such services. See i2p.md for details. (#20685)\n\nThis release removes support for Tor version 2 hidden services in favor of Tor\nv3 only, as the Tor network dropped support for Tor\nv2 with the release of\nTor version 0.4.6.  Henceforth, Bitcoin Core ignores Tor v2 addresses; it\nneither rumors them over the network to other peers, nor stores them in memory\nor to peers.dat.  (#22050)\n\nAdded NAT-PMP port mapping support via\nlibnatpmp. (#18077)\n\nNew and Updated RPCs\n\n\nDue to BIP 350\nbeing implemented, behavior for all RPCs that accept addresses is changed when\na native witness version 1 (or higher) is passed. These now require a Bech32m\nencoding instead of a Bech32 one, and Bech32m encoding will be used for such\naddresses in RPC output as well. No version 1 addresses should be created\nfor mainnet until consensus rules are adopted that give them meaning\n(as will happen through BIP 341).\nOnce that happens, Bech32m is expected to be used for them, so this shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\naffect any production systems, but may be observed on other networks where such\naddresses already have meaning (like signet). (#20861)\n\n\nThe getpeerinfo RPC returns two new boolean fields, bip152_hb_to and\nbip152_hb_from, that respectively indicate whether we selected a peer to be\nin compact blocks high-bandwidth mode or whether a peer selected us as a\ncompact blocks high-bandwidth peer. High-bandwidth peers send new block\nannouncements via a cmpctblock message rather than the usual inv/headers\nannouncements. See BIP 152 for more details. (#19776)\n\n\ngetpeerinfo no longer returns the following fields: addnode, banscore,\nand whitelisted, which were previously deprecated in 0.21. Instead of\naddnode, the connection_type field returns manual. Instead of\nwhitelisted, the permissions field indicates if the peer has special\nprivileges. The banscore field has simply been removed. (#20755)\n\n\nThe following RPCs:  gettxout, getrawtransaction, decoderawtransaction,\ndecodescript, gettransaction, and REST endpoints: /rest/tx,\n/rest/getutxos, /rest/block deprecated the following fields (which are no\nlonger returned in the responses by default): addresses, reqSigs.\nThe -deprecatedrpc=addresses flag must be passed for these fields to be\nincluded in the RPC response. This flag/option will be available only for this major release, after which\nthe deprecation will be removed entirely. Note that these fields are attributes of\nthe scriptPubKey object returned in the RPC response. However, in the response\nof decodescript these fields are top-level attributes, and included again as attributes\nof the scriptPubKey object. (#20286)\n\n\nWhen creating a hex-encoded bitcoin transaction using the bitcoin-tx utility\nwith the -json option set, the following fields: addresses, reqSigs are no longer\nreturned in the tx output of the response. (#20286)\n\n\nThe listbanned RPC now returns two new numeric fields: ban_duration and time_remaining.\nRespectively, these new fields indicate the duration of a ban and the time remaining until a ban expires,\nboth in seconds. Additionally, the ban_created field is repositioned to come before banned_until. (#21602)\n\n\nThe setban RPC can ban onion addresses again. This fixes a regression introduced in version 0.21.0. (#20852)\n\n\nThe getnodeaddresses RPC now returns a \u00e2\u0080\u009cnetwork\u00e2\u0080\u009d field indicating the\nnetwork type (ipv4, ipv6, onion, or i2p) for each address.  (#21594)\n\n\ngetnodeaddresses now also accepts a \u00e2\u0080\u009cnetwork\u00e2\u0080\u009d argument (ipv4, ipv6, onion,\nor i2p) to return only addresses of the specified network.  (#21843)\n\n\nThe testmempoolaccept RPC now accepts multiple transactions (still experimental at the moment,\nAPI may be unstable). This is intended for testing transaction packages with dependency\nrelationships; it is not recommended for batch-validating independent transactions. In addition to\nmempool policy, package policies apply: the list cannot contain more than 25 transactions or have a\ntotal size exceeding 101K virtual bytes, and cannot conflict with (spend the same inputs as) each other or\nthe mempool, even if it would be a valid BIP125 replace-by-fee. There are some known limitations to\nthe accuracy of the test accept: it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible for testmempoolaccept to return \u00e2\u0080\u009callowed\u00e2\u0080\u009d=True for a\ngroup of transactions, but \u00e2\u0080\u009ctoo-long-mempool-chain\u00e2\u0080\u009d if they are actually submitted. (#20833)\n\n\naddmultisigaddress and createmultisig now support up to 20 keys for\nSegwit addresses. (#20867)\n\n\nChanges to Wallet or GUI related RPCs can be found in the GUI or Wallet section below.\nBuild System\n\nRelease binaries are now produced using the new guix-based build system.\nThe /doc/release-process.md document has been updated accordingly.\n\nFiles\n\nThe list of banned hosts and networks (via setban RPC) is now saved on disk\nin JSON format in banlist.json instead of banlist.dat. banlist.dat is\nonly read on startup if banlist.json is not present. Changes are only written to the new\nbanlist.json. A future version of Bitcoin Core may completely ignore\nbanlist.dat. (#20966)\n\nNew settings\n\nThe -natpmp option has been added to use NAT-PMP to map the listening port.\nIf both UPnP and NAT-PMP are enabled, a successful allocation from UPnP\nprevails over one from NAT-PMP. (#18077)\n\nUpdated settings\nChanges to Wallet or GUI related settings can be found in the GUI or Wallet section below.\n\nPassing an invalid -rpcauth argument now cause bitcoind to fail to start.  (#20461)\n\nTools and Utilities\n\n\nA new CLI -addrinfo command returns the number of addresses known to the\nnode per network type (including Tor v2 versus v3) and total. This can be\nuseful to see if the node knows enough addresses in a network to use options\nlike -onlynet=<network> or to upgrade to this release of Bitcoin Core 22.0\nthat supports Tor v3 only.  (#21595)\n\n\nA new -rpcwaittimeout argument to bitcoin-cli sets the timeout\nin seconds to use with -rpcwait. If the timeout expires,\nbitcoin-cli will report a failure. (#21056)\n\n\nWallet\n\n\nExternal signers such as hardware wallets can now be used through the new RPC methods enumeratesigners and displayaddress. Support is also added to the send RPC call. This feature is experimental. See external-signer.md for details. (#16546)\n\n\nA new listdescriptors RPC is available to inspect the contents of descriptor-enabled wallets.\nThe RPC returns public versions of all imported descriptors, including their timestamp and flags.\nFor ranged descriptors, it also returns the range boundaries and the next index to generate addresses from. (#20226)\n\n\nThe bumpfee RPC is not available with wallets that have private keys\ndisabled. psbtbumpfee can be used instead. (#20891)\n\n\nThe fundrawtransaction, send and walletcreatefundedpsbt RPCs now support an include_unsafe option\nthat when true allows using unsafe inputs to fund the transaction.\nNote that the resulting transaction may become invalid if one of the unsafe inputs disappears.\nIf that happens, the transaction must be funded with different inputs and republished. (#21359)\n\n\nWe now support up to 20 keys in multi() and sortedmulti() descriptors\nunder wsh(). (#20867)\n\n\nTaproot descriptors can be imported into the wallet only after activation has occurred on the network (e.g. mainnet, testnet, signet) in use. See descriptors.md for supported descriptors.\n\n\nGUI changes\n\nExternal signers such as hardware wallets can now be used. These require an external tool such as HWI to be installed and configured under Options -> Wallet. When creating a new wallet a new option \u00e2\u0080\u009cExternal signer\u00e2\u0080\u009d will appear in the dialog. If the device is detected, its name is suggested as the wallet name. The watch-only keys are then automatically imported. Receive addresses can be verified on the device. The send dialog will automatically use the connected device. This feature is experimental and the UI may freeze for a few seconds when performing these actions.\n\nLow-level changes\nRPC\n\n\nThe RPC server can process a limited number of simultaneous RPC requests.\nPreviously, if this limit was exceeded, the RPC server would respond with\nstatus code 500 (HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR).\nNow it returns status code 503 (HTTP_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE). (#18335)\n\n\nError codes have been updated to be more accurate for the following error cases (#18466):\n\nsignmessage now returns RPC_INVALID_ADDRESS_OR_KEY (-5) if the\npassed address is invalid. Previously returned RPC_TYPE_ERROR (-3).\nverifymessage now returns RPC_INVALID_ADDRESS_OR_KEY (-5) if the\npassed address is invalid. Previously returned RPC_TYPE_ERROR (-3).\nverifymessage now returns RPC_TYPE_ERROR (-3) if the passed signature\nis malformed. Previously returned RPC_INVALID_ADDRESS_OR_KEY (-5).\n\n\n\nTests\n22.0 change log\nA detailed list of changes in this version follows.

These now require a Bech32m\nencoding instead of a Bech32 one, and Bech32m encoding will be used for such\naddresses in RPC output as well. No version 1 addresses should be created\nfor mainnet until consensus rules are adopted that give them meaning\n(as will happen through <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki\">BIP 341</a>).\nOnce that happens, Bech32m is expected to be used for them, so this shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\naffect any production systems, but may be observed on other networks where such\naddresses already have meaning (like signet). (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20861\">#20861</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getpeerinfo</code> RPC returns two new boolean fields, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bip152_hb_to</code> and\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bip152_hb_from</code>, that respectively indicate whether we selected a peer to be\nin compact blocks high-bandwidth mode or whether a peer selected us as a\ncompact blocks high-bandwidth peer. High-bandwidth peers send new block\nannouncements via a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">cmpctblock</code> message rather than the usual inv/headers\nannouncements.

This flag/option will be available only for this major release, after which\nthe deprecation will be removed entirely. Note that these fields are attributes of\nthe <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">scriptPubKey</code> object returned in the RPC response. However, in the response\nof <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">decodescript</code> these fields are top-level attributes, and included again as attributes\nof the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">scriptPubKey</code> object. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20286\">#20286</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When creating a hex-encoded bitcoin transaction using the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin-tx</code> utility\nwith the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-json</code> option set, the following fields: <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">addresses</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">reqSigs</code> are no longer\nreturned in the tx output of the response. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20286\">#20286</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">listbanned</code> RPC now returns two new numeric fields: <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">ban_duration</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">time_remaining</code>.\nRespectively, these new fields indicate the duration of a ban and the time remaining until a ban expires,\nboth in seconds. Additionally, the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">ban_created</code> field is repositioned to come before <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">banned_until</code>.

This is intended for testing transaction packages with dependency\nrelationships; it is not recommended for batch-validating independent transactions. In addition to\nmempool policy, package policies apply: the list cannot contain more than 25 transactions or have a\ntotal size exceeding 101K virtual bytes, and cannot conflict with (spend the same inputs as) each other or\nthe mempool, even if it would be a valid BIP125 replace-by-fee. There are some known limitations to\nthe accuracy of the test accept: it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible for <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">testmempoolaccept</code> to return \u00e2\u0080\u009callowed\u00e2\u0080\u009d=True for a\ngroup of transactions, but \u00e2\u0080\u009ctoo-long-mempool-chain\u00e2\u0080\u009d if they are actually submitted.

Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac)\nor bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).\nUpgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\npossible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\nwallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\nCompatibility\nBitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\nusing the Linux kernel, macOS 10.12+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Bitcoin\nCore should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\nfrequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\nunsupported systems.\nFrom Bitcoin Core 0.20.0 onwards, macOS versions earlier than 10.12 are no\nlonger supported. Additionally, Bitcoin Core does not yet change appearance\nwhen macOS \u00e2\u0080\u009cdark mode\u00e2\u0080\u009d is activated.\nNotable changes\nTaproot Soft Fork\nIncluded in this release are the mainnet and testnet activation\nparameters for the taproot soft fork (BIP341) which also adds support\nfor schnorr signatures (BIP340) and tapscript (BIP342).\nIf activated, these improvements will allow users of single-signature\nscripts, multisignature scripts, and complex contracts to all use\nidentical-appearing commitments that enhance their privacy and the\nfungibility of all bitcoins. Spenders will enjoy lower fees and the\nability to resolve many multisig scripts and complex contracts with the\nsame efficiency, low fees, and large anonymity set as single-sig users.\nTaproot and schnorr also include efficiency improvements for full nodes\nsuch as the ability to batch signature verification.  Together, the\nimprovements lay the groundwork for future potential\nupgrades that may improve efficiency, privacy, and fungibility further.\nActivation for taproot is being managed using a variation of BIP9\nversionbits called Speedy Trial (described in BIP341). Taproot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nversionbit is bit 2, and nodes will begin tracking which blocks signal\nsupport for taproot at the beginning of the first retarget period after\ntaproot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s start date of 24 April 2021.  If 90% of blocks within a\n2,016-block retarget period (about two weeks) signal support for taproot\nprior to the first retarget period beginning after the time of 11 August\n2021, the soft fork will be locked in, and taproot will then be active\nas of block 709632 (expected in early or mid November).\nShould taproot not be locked in via Speedy Trial activation, it is\nexpected that a follow-up activation mechanism will be deployed, with\nchanges to address the reasons the Speedy Trial method failed.\nThis release includes the ability to pay taproot addresses, although\npayments to such addresses are not secure until taproot activates.\nIt also includes the ability to relay and mine taproot transactions\nafter activation.  Beyond those two basic capabilities, this release\ndoes not include any code that allows anyone to directly use taproot.\nThe addition of taproot-related features to Bitcoin Core\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wallet is\nexpected in later releases once taproot activation is assured.\nAll users, businesses, and miners are encouraged to upgrade to this\nrelease (or a subsequent compatible release) unless they object to\nactivation of taproot.  If taproot is locked in, then upgrading before\nblock 709632 is highly recommended to help enforce taproot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new rules\nand to avoid the unlikely case of seeing falsely confirmed transactions.\nMiners who want to activate Taproot should preferably use this release\nto control their signaling.  The getblocktemplate RPC results will\nautomatically be updated to signal once the appropriate start has been\nreached and continue signaling until the timeout occurs or taproot\nactivates.  Alternatively, miners may manually start signaling on bit 2\nat any time; if taproot activates, they will need to ensure they update\ntheir nodes before block 709632 or non-upgraded nodes could cause them to mine on\nan invalid chain.  See the versionbits\nFAQ for\ndetails.\nFor more information about taproot, please see the following resources:\n\nTechnical specifications\n    \nBIP340 Schnorr signatures for secp256k1\nBIP341 Taproot: SegWit version 1 spending rules\nBIP342 Validation of Taproot scripts\n\n\nPopular articles;\n    \nTaproot Is Coming: What It Is, and How It Will Benefit Bitcoin\nWhat do Schnorr Signatures Mean for Bitcoin?\nThe Schnorr Signature & Taproot Softfork Proposal\n\n\nDevelopment history overview\n    \nTaproot\nSchnorr signatures\nTapscript\nSoft fork activation\n\n\nOther\n    \nQuestions and answers related to taproot\nTaproot review\n\n\n\nUpdated RPCs\n\nDue to BIP 350\nbeing implemented, behavior for all RPCs that accept addresses is changed when\na native witness version 1 (or higher) is passed. These now require a Bech32m\nencoding instead of a Bech32 one, and Bech32m encoding will be used for such\naddresses in RPC output as well. No version 1 addresses should be created\nfor mainnet until consensus rules are adopted that give them meaning\n(e.g. through BIP 341).\nOnce that happens, Bech32m is expected to be used for them, so this shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\naffect any production systems, but may be observed on other networks where such\naddresses already have meaning (like signet).\n\n0.21.1 change log\nConsensus\n\n#21377 Speedy trial support for versionbits (ajtowns)\n#21686 Speedy trial activation parameters for Taproot (achow101)\n\nP2P protocol and network code\n\n#20852 allow CSubNet of non-IP networks (vasild)\n#21043 Avoid UBSan warning in ProcessMessage(\u00e2\u0080\u00a6) (practicalswift)\n\nWallet\n\n#21166 Introduce DeferredSignatureChecker and have SignatureExtractorClass subclass it (achow101)\n#21083 Avoid requesting fee rates multiple times during coin selection (achow101)\n\nRPC and other APIs\n\n#21201 Disallow sendtoaddress and sendmany when private keys disabled (achow101)\n\nBuild system\n\n#21486 link against -lsocket if required for *ifaddrs (fanquake)\n#20983 Fix MSVC build after gui#176 (hebasto)\n\nTests and QA\n\n#21380 Add fuzzing harness for versionbits (ajtowns)\n#20812 fuzz: Bump FuzzedDataProvider.h (MarcoFalke)\n#20740 fuzz: Update FuzzedDataProvider.h from upstream (LLVM) (practicalswift)\n#21446 Update vcpkg checkout commit (sipsorcery)\n#21397 fuzz: Bump FuzzedDataProvider.h (MarcoFalke)\n#21081 Fix the unreachable code at feature_taproot (brunoerg)\n#20562 Test that a fully signed tx given to signrawtx is unchanged (achow101)\n#21571 Make sure non-IP peers get discouraged and disconnected (vasild, MarcoFalke)\n#21489 fuzz: cleanups for versionbits fuzzer (ajtowns)\n\nMiscellaneous\n\n#20861 BIP 350: Implement Bech32m and use it for v1+ segwit addresses (sipa)\n\nDocumentation\n\n#21384 add signet to bitcoin.conf documentation (jonatack)\n#21342 Remove outdated comment (hebasto)\n\nCredits\nThanks to everyone who directly contributed to this release:\n\nAaron Clauson\nAndrew Chow\nAnthony Towns\nBruno Garcia\nFabian Jahr\nfanquake\nHennadii Stepanov\nJon Atack\nLuke Dashjr\nMarcoFalke\nPieter Wuille\npracticalswift\nrandymcmillan\nSjors Provoost\nVasil Dimov\nW.

Additionally, Bitcoin Core does not yet change appearance\nwhen macOS \u00e2\u0080\u009cdark mode\u00e2\u0080\u009d is activated.</p>\n<h1 id=\"notable-changes\">Notable changes</h1>\n<h2 id=\"taproot-soft-fork\">Taproot Soft Fork</h2>\n<p>Included in this release are the mainnet and testnet activation\nparameters for the taproot soft fork (BIP341) which also adds support\nfor schnorr signatures (BIP340) and tapscript (BIP342).</p>\n<p>If activated, these improvements will allow users of single-signature\nscripts, multisignature scripts, and complex contracts to all use\nidentical-appearing commitments that enhance their privacy and the\nfungibility of all bitcoins. Spenders will enjoy lower fees and the\nability to resolve many multisig scripts and complex contracts with the\nsame efficiency, low fees, and large anonymity set as single-sig users.\nTaproot and schnorr also include efficiency improvements for full nodes\nsuch as the ability to batch signature verification.  Together, the\nimprovements lay the groundwork for future potential\nupgrades that may improve efficiency, privacy, and fungibility further.</p>\n<p>Activation for taproot is being managed using a variation of BIP9\nversionbits called Speedy Trial (described in BIP341). Taproot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nversionbit is bit 2, and nodes will begin tracking which blocks signal\nsupport for taproot at the beginning of the first retarget period after\ntaproot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s start date of 24 April 2021.  If 90% of blocks within a\n2,016-block retarget period (about two weeks) signal support for taproot\nprior to the first retarget period beginning after the time of 11 August\n2021, the soft fork will be locked in, and taproot will then be active\nas of block 709632 (expected in early or mid November).</p>\n<p>Should taproot not be locked in via Speedy Trial activation, it is\nexpected that a follow-up activation mechanism will be deployed, with\nchanges to address the reasons the Speedy Trial method failed.</p>\n<p>This release includes the ability to pay taproot addresses, although\npayments to such addresses are not secure until taproot activates.\nIt also includes the ability to relay and mine taproot transactions\nafter activation.  Beyond those two basic capabilities, this release\ndoes not include any code that allows anyone to directly use taproot.\nThe addition of taproot-related features to Bitcoin Core\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wallet is\nexpected in later releases once taproot activation is assured.</p>\n<p>All users, businesses, and miners are encouraged to upgrade to this\nrelease (or a subsequent compatible release) unless they object to\nactivation of taproot.  If taproot is locked in, then upgrading before\nblock 709632 is highly recommended to help enforce taproot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new rules\nand to avoid the unlikely case of seeing falsely confirmed transactions.</p>\n<p>Miners who want to activate Taproot should preferably use this release\nto control their signaling.  The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getblocktemplate</code> RPC results will\nautomatically be updated to signal once the appropriate start has been\nreached and continue signaling until the timeout occurs or taproot\nactivates.  Alternatively, miners may manually start signaling on bit 2\nat any time; if taproot activates, they will need to ensure they update\ntheir nodes before block 709632 or non-upgraded nodes could cause them to mine on\nan invalid chain.

Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac)\nor bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).\nUpgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\npossible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\nwallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\nCompatibility\nBitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\nusing the Linux kernel, macOS 10.12+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Bitcoin\nCore should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\nfrequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\nunsupported systems.\nFrom Bitcoin Core 0.20.0 onwards, macOS versions earlier than 10.12 are no\nlonger supported. Additionally, Bitcoin Core does not yet change appearance\nwhen macOS \u00e2\u0080\u009cdark mode\u00e2\u0080\u009d is activated.\nThe node\u00e2\u0080\u0099s known peers are persisted to disk in a file called peers.dat. The\nformat of this file has been changed in a backwards-incompatible way in order to\naccommodate the storage of Tor v3 and other BIP155 addresses. This means that if\nthe file is modified by 0.21.0 or newer then older versions will not be able to\nread it. Those old versions, in the event of a downgrade, will log an error\nmessage \u00e2\u0080\u009cIncorrect keysize in addrman deserialization\u00e2\u0080\u009d and will continue normal\noperation as if the file was missing, creating a new empty one. (#19954, #20284)\nNotable changes\nP2P and network changes\n\n\nThe mempool now tracks whether transactions submitted via the wallet or RPCs\nhave been successfully broadcast. Every 10-15 minutes, the node will try to\nannounce unbroadcast transactions until a peer requests it via a getdata\nmessage or the transaction is removed from the mempool for other reasons.\nThe node will not track the broadcast status of transactions submitted to the\nnode using P2P relay. This version reduces the initial broadcast guarantees\nfor wallet transactions submitted via P2P to a node running the wallet. (#18038)\n\n\nThe size of the set of transactions that peers have announced and we consider\nfor requests has been reduced from 100000 to 5000 (per peer), and further\nannouncements will be ignored when that limit is reached. If you need to dump\n(very) large batches of transactions, exceptions can be made for trusted\npeers using the \u00e2\u0080\u009crelay\u00e2\u0080\u009d network permission. For localhost for example it can\nbe enabled using the command line option -whitelist=relay@127.0.0.1.\n(#19988)\n\n\nThis release adds support for Tor version 3 hidden services, and rumoring them\nover the network to other peers using\nBIP155.\nVersion 2 hidden services are still fully supported by Bitcoin Core, but the\nTor network will start\ndeprecating them in the\ncoming months. (#19954)\n\n\nThe Tor onion service that is automatically created by setting the\n-listenonion configuration parameter will now be created as a Tor v3 service\ninstead of Tor v2. The private key that was used for Tor v2 (if any) will be\nleft untouched in the onion_private_key file in the data directory (see\n-datadir) and can be removed if not needed. Bitcoin Core will no longer\nattempt to read it. The private key for the Tor v3 service will be saved in a\nfile named onion_v3_private_key. To use the deprecated Tor v2 service (not\nrecommended), the onion_private_key can be copied over\nonion_v3_private_key, e.g.\ncp -f onion_private_key onion_v3_private_key. (#19954)\n\n\nThe client writes a file (anchors.dat) at shutdown with the network addresses\nof the node\u00e2\u0080\u0099s two outbound block-relay-only peers (so called \u00e2\u0080\u009canchors\u00e2\u0080\u009d). The\nnext time the node starts, it reads this file and attempts to reconnect to those\nsame two peers. This prevents an attacker from using node restarts to trigger a\ncomplete change in peers, which would be something they could use as part of an\neclipse attack. (#17428)\n\n\nThis release adds support for serving\nBIP157 compact\nfilters to peers on the network when enabled using\n-blockfilterindex=1 -peerblockfilters=1. (#16442)\n\n\nThis release adds support for signets\n(BIP325) in\naddition to the existing mainnet, testnet, and regtest networks. Signets are\ncentrally-controlled test networks, allowing them to be more predictable\ntest environments than the older testnet. One public signet is maintained, and\nselectable using -signet. It is also possible to create personal signets.\n(#18267).\n\n\nThis release implements\nBIP339\nwtxid relay. When negotiated, transactions are announced using their wtxid\ninstead of their txid. (#18044).\n\n\nThis release implements the proposed Taproot consensus rules\n(BIP341 and\nBIP342),\nwithout activation on mainnet. Experimentation with Taproot can be done on\nsignet, where its rules are already active. (#19553)\n\n\nUpdated RPCs\n\n\nThe getpeerinfo RPC has a new network field that provides the type of\nnetwork (\u00e2\u0080\u009cipv4\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cipv6\u00e2\u0080\u009d, or \u00e2\u0080\u009conion\u00e2\u0080\u009d) that the peer connected through. (#20002)\n\n\nThe getpeerinfo RPC now has additional last_block and last_transaction\nfields that return the UNIX epoch time of the last block and the last valid\ntransaction received from each peer. (#19731)\n\n\ngetnetworkinfo now returns two new fields, connections_in and\nconnections_out, that provide the number of inbound and outbound peer\nconnections. These new fields are in addition to the existing connections\nfield, which returns the total number of peer connections. (#19405)\n\n\nExposed transaction version numbers are now treated as unsigned 32-bit\nintegers instead of signed 32-bit integers. This matches their treatment in\nconsensus logic. Versions greater than 2 continue to be non-standard\n(matching previous behavior of smaller than 1 or greater than 2 being\nnon-standard). Note that this includes the joinpsbt command, which combines\npartially-signed transactions by selecting the highest version number.\n(#16525)\n\n\ngetmempoolinfo now returns an additional unbroadcastcount field. The\nmempool tracks locally submitted transactions until their initial broadcast\nis acknowledged by a peer. This field returns the count of transactions\nwaiting for acknowledgement.\n\n\nMempool RPCs such as getmempoolentry and getrawmempool with\nverbose=true now return an additional unbroadcast field. This indicates\nwhether initial broadcast of the transaction has been acknowledged by a\npeer. getmempoolancestors and getmempooldescendants are also updated.\n\n\nThe getpeerinfo RPC no longer returns the banscore field unless the configuration\noption -deprecatedrpc=banscore is used. The banscore field will be fully\nremoved in the next major release. (#19469)\n\n\nThe testmempoolaccept RPC returns vsize and a fees object with the base fee\nif the transaction would pass validation. (#19940)\n\n\nThe getpeerinfo RPC now returns a connection_type field. This indicates\nthe type of connection established with the peer. It will return one of six\noptions. For more information, see the getpeerinfo help documentation.\n(#19725)\n\n\nThe getpeerinfo RPC no longer returns the addnode field by default. This\nfield will be fully removed in the next major release.  It can be accessed\nwith the configuration option -deprecatedrpc=getpeerinfo_addnode. However,\nit is recommended to instead use the connection_type field (it will return\nmanual when addnode is true). (#19725)\n\n\nThe getpeerinfo RPC no longer returns the whitelisted field by default. \nThis field will be fully removed in the next major release. It can be accessed \nwith the configuration option -deprecatedrpc=getpeerinfo_whitelisted. However, \nit is recommended to instead use the permissions field to understand if specific \nprivileges have been granted to the peer. (#19770)\n\n\nThe walletcreatefundedpsbt RPC call will now fail with\nInsufficient funds when inputs are manually selected but are not enough to cover\nthe outputs and fee. Additional inputs can automatically be added through the\nnew add_inputs option. (#16377)\n\n\nThe fundrawtransaction RPC now supports add_inputs option that when false\nprevents adding more inputs if necessary and consequently the RPC fails.\n\n\nChanges to Wallet or GUI related RPCs can be found in the GUI or Wallet section below.\nNew RPCs\n\nThe getindexinfo RPC returns the actively running indices of the node,\nincluding their current sync status and height. It also accepts an index_name\nto specify returning the status of that index only. (#19550)\n\nBuild System\nUpdated settings\n\n\nThe same ZeroMQ notification (e.g. -zmqpubhashtx=address) can now be\nspecified multiple times to publish the same notification to different ZeroMQ\nsockets. (#18309)\n\n\nThe -banscore configuration option, which modified the default threshold for\ndisconnecting and discouraging misbehaving peers, has been removed as part of\nchanges in 0.20.1 and in this release to the handling of misbehaving peers.\nRefer to \u00e2\u0080\u009cChanges regarding misbehaving peers\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the 0.20.1 release notes for\ndetails. (#19464)\n\n\nThe -debug=db logging category, which was deprecated in 0.20 and replaced by\n-debug=walletdb to distinguish it from coindb, has been removed. (#19202)\n\n\nA download permission has been extracted from the noban permission. For\ncompatibility, noban implies the download permission, but this may change\nin future releases. Refer to the help of the affected settings -whitebind\nand -whitelist for more details. (#19191)\n\n\nNetmasks that contain 1-bits after 0-bits (the 1-bits are not contiguous on\nthe left side, e.g. 255.0.255.255) are no longer accepted. They are invalid\naccording to RFC 4632. Netmasks are used in the -rpcallowip and -whitelist\nconfiguration options and in the setban RPC. (#19628)\n\n\nThe -blocksonly setting now completely disables fee estimation. (#18766)\n\n\nChanges to Wallet or GUI related settings can be found in the GUI or Wallet section below.\nTools and Utilities\n\n\nA new bitcoin-cli -netinfo command provides a network peer connections\ndashboard that displays data from the getpeerinfo and getnetworkinfo RPCs\nin a human-readable format. An optional integer argument from 0 to 4 may\nbe passed to see increasing levels of detail. (#19643)\n\n\nA new bitcoin-cli -generate command, equivalent to RPC generatenewaddress\nfollowed by generatetoaddress, can generate blocks for command line testing\npurposes. This is a client-side version of the former generate RPC. See the\nhelp for details. (#19133)\n\n\nThe bitcoin-cli -getinfo command now displays the wallet name and balance for\neach of the loaded wallets when more than one is loaded (e.g. in multiwallet\nmode) and a wallet is not specified with -rpcwallet. (#18594)\n\n\nThe connections field of bitcoin-cli -getinfo is now expanded to return a JSON\nobject with in, out and total numbers of peer connections. It previously\nreturned a single integer value for the total number of peer connections. (#19405)\n\n\nNew settings\n\nThe startupnotify option is used to specify a command to\nexecute when Bitcoin Core has finished with its startup\nsequence. (#15367)\n\nWallet\n\n\nBackwards compatibility has been dropped for two getaddressinfo RPC\ndeprecations, as notified in the 0.20 release notes. The deprecated label\nfield has been removed as well as the deprecated labels behavior of\nreturning a JSON object containing name and purpose key-value pairs. Since\n0.20, the labels field returns a JSON array of label names. (#19200)\n\n\nTo improve wallet privacy, the frequency of wallet rebroadcast attempts is\nreduced from approximately once every 15 minutes to once every 12-36 hours.\nTo maintain a similar level of guarantee for initial broadcast of wallet\ntransactions, the mempool tracks these transactions as a part of the newly\nintroduced unbroadcast set. See the \u00e2\u0080\u009cP2P and network changes\u00e2\u0080\u009d section for\nmore information on the unbroadcast set. (#18038)\n\n\nThe sendtoaddress and sendmany RPCs accept an optional verbose=True\nargument to also return the fee reason about the sent tx. (#19501)\n\n\nThe wallet can create a transaction without change even when the keypool is\nempty. Previously it failed. (#17219)\n\n\nThe -salvagewallet startup option has been removed. A new salvage command\nhas been added to the bitcoin-wallet tool which performs the salvage\noperations that -salvagewallet did. (#18918)\n\n\nA new configuration flag -maxapsfee has been added, which sets the max\nallowed avoid partial spends (APS) fee. It defaults to 0 (i.e. fee is the\nsame with and without APS). Setting it to -1 will disable APS, unless\n-avoidpartialspends is set. (#14582)\n\n\nThe wallet will now avoid partial spends (APS) by default, if this does not\nresult in a difference in fees compared to the non-APS variant. The allowed\nfee threshold can be adjusted using the new -maxapsfee configuration\noption. (#14582)\n\n\nThe createwallet, loadwallet, and unloadwallet RPCs now accept\nload_on_startup options to modify the settings list. Unless these options\nare explicitly set to true or false, the list is not modified, so the RPC\nmethods remain backwards compatible. (#15937)\n\n\nA new send RPC with similar syntax to walletcreatefundedpsbt, including\nsupport for coin selection and a custom fee rate, is added. The send RPC is\nexperimental and may change in subsequent releases. (#16378)\n\n\nThe estimate_mode parameter is now case-insensitive in the bumpfee,\nfundrawtransaction, sendmany, sendtoaddress, send and\nwalletcreatefundedpsbt RPCs. (#11413)\n\n\nThe bumpfee RPC now uses conf_target rather than confTarget in the\noptions. (#11413)\n\n\nfundrawtransaction and walletcreatefundedpsbt when used with the\nlockUnspents argument now lock manually selected coins, in addition to\nautomatically selected coins. Note that locked coins are never used in\nautomatic coin selection, but can still be manually selected. (#18244)\n\n\nThe -zapwallettxes startup option has been removed and its functionality\nremoved from the wallet.  This option was originally intended to allow for\nrescuing wallets which were affected by a malleability attack. More recently,\nit has been used in the fee bumping of transactions that did not signal RBF.\nThis functionality has been superseded with the abandon transaction feature. (#19671)\n\n\nThe error code when no wallet is loaded, but a wallet RPC is called, has been\nchanged from -32601 (method not found) to -18 (wallet not found).\n(#20101)\n\n\nAutomatic wallet creation removed\nBitcoin Core will no longer automatically create new wallets on startup. It will\nload existing wallets specified by -wallet options on the command line or in\nbitcoin.conf or settings.json files. And by default it will also load a\ntop-level unnamed (\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u009d) wallet. However, if specified wallets don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exist,\nBitcoin Core will now just log warnings instead of creating new wallets with\nnew keys and addresses like previous releases did.\nNew wallets can be created through the GUI (which has a more prominent create\nwallet option), through the bitcoin-cli createwallet or bitcoin-wallet\ncreate commands, or the createwallet RPC. (#15454, #20186)\nExperimental Descriptor Wallets\nPlease note that Descriptor Wallets are still experimental and not all expected functionality\nis available. Additionally there may be some bugs and current functions may change in the future.\nBugs and missing functionality can be reported to the issue tracker.\n0.21 introduces a new type of wallet - Descriptor Wallets. Descriptor Wallets store\nscriptPubKey information using output descriptors. This is in contrast to the Legacy Wallet\nstructure where keys are used to implicitly generate scriptPubKeys and addresses. Because of this\nshift to being script based instead of key based, many of the confusing things that Legacy\nWallets do are not possible with Descriptor Wallets. Descriptor Wallets use a definition\nof \u00e2\u0080\u009cmine\u00e2\u0080\u009d for scripts which is simpler and more intuitive than that used by Legacy Wallets.\nDescriptor Wallets also uses different semantics for watch-only things and imports.\nAs Descriptor Wallets are a new type of wallet, their introduction does not affect existing wallets.\nUsers who already have a Bitcoin Core wallet can continue to use it as they did before without\nany change in behavior. Newly created Legacy Wallets (which remains the default type of wallet) will\nbehave as they did in previous versions of Bitcoin Core.\nThe differences between Descriptor Wallets and Legacy Wallets are largely limited to non user facing\nthings. They are intended to behave similarly except for the import/export and watchonly functionality\nas described below.\nCreating Descriptor Wallets\nDescriptor wallets are not the default type of wallet.\nIn the GUI, a checkbox has been added to the Create Wallet Dialog to indicate that a\nDescriptor Wallet should be created. And a descriptors option has been added to createwallet RPC.\nSetting descriptors to true will create a Descriptor Wallet instead of a Legacy Wallet.\nWithout those options being set, a Legacy Wallet will be created instead.\nIsMine Semantics\nIsMine refers to the function used to determine whether a script belongs to the wallet.\nThis is used to determine whether an output belongs to the wallet. IsMine in Legacy Wallets\nreturns true if the wallet would be able to sign an input that spends an output with that script.\nSince keys can be involved in a variety of different scripts, this definition for IsMine can\nlead to many unexpected scripts being considered part of the wallet.\nWith Descriptor Wallets, descriptors explicitly specify the set of scripts that are owned by\nthe wallet. Since descriptors are deterministic and easily enumerable, users will know exactly\nwhat scripts the wallet will consider to belong to it. Additionally the implementation of IsMine\nin Descriptor Wallets is far simpler than for Legacy Wallets. Notably, in Legacy Wallets, IsMine\nallowed for users to take one type of address (e.g. P2PKH), mutate it into another address type\n(e.g. P2WPKH), and the wallet would still detect outputs sending to the new address type\neven without that address being requested from the wallet. Descriptor Wallets do not\nallow for this and will only watch for the addresses that were explicitly requested from the wallet.\nThese changes to IsMine will make it easier to reason about what scripts the wallet will\nactually be watching for in outputs. However for the vast majority of users, this change is\nlargely transparent and will not have noticeable effect.\nImports and Exports\nIn Legacy Wallets, raw scripts and keys could be imported to the wallet. Those imported scripts\nand keys are treated separately from the keys generated by the wallet. This complicates the IsMine\nlogic as it has to distinguish between spendable and watchonly.\nDescriptor Wallets handle importing scripts and keys differently. Only complete descriptors can be\nimported. These descriptors are then added to the wallet as if it were a descriptor generated by\nthe wallet itself. This simplifies the IsMine logic so that it no longer has to distinguish\nbetween spendable and watchonly. As such, the watchonly model for Descriptor Wallets is also\ndifferent and described in more detail in the next section.\nTo import into a Descriptor Wallet, a new importdescriptors RPC has been added that uses a syntax\nsimilar to that of importmulti.\nAs Legacy Wallets and Descriptor Wallets use different mechanisms for storing and importing scripts and keys\nthe existing import RPCs have been disabled for descriptor wallets.\nNew export RPCs for Descriptor Wallets have not yet been added.\nThe following RPCs are disabled for Descriptor Wallets:\n\nimportprivkey\nimportpubkey\nimportaddress\nimportwallet\ndumpprivkey\ndumpwallet\nimportmulti\naddmultisigaddress\nsethdseed\n\nWatchonly Wallets\nA Legacy Wallet contains both private keys and scripts that were being watched.\nThose watched scripts would not contribute to your normal balance. In order to see the watchonly\nbalance and to use watchonly things in transactions, an include_watchonly option was added\nto many RPCs that would allow users to do that. However it is easy to forget to include this option.\nDescriptor Wallets move to a per-wallet watchonly model. Instead an entire wallet is considered to be\nwatchonly depending on whether it was created with private keys disabled. This eliminates the need\nto distinguish between things that are watchonly and things that are not within a wallet itself.\nThis change does have a caveat. If a Descriptor Wallet with private keys enabled has\na multiple key descriptor without all of the private keys (e.g. multi(...) with only one private key),\nthen the wallet will fail to sign and broadcast transactions. Such wallets would need to use the PSBT\nworkflow but the typical GUI Send, sendtoaddress, etc. workflows would still be available, just\nnon-functional.\nThis issue is worsened if the wallet contains both single key (e.g. wpkh(...)) descriptors and such\nmultiple key descriptors as some transactions could be signed and broadcast and others not. This is\ndue to some transactions containing only single key inputs, while others would contain both single\nkey and multiple key inputs, depending on which are available and how the coin selection algorithm\nselects inputs. However this is not considered to be a supported use case; multisigs\nshould be in their own wallets which do not already have descriptors. Although users cannot export\ndescriptors with private keys for now as explained earlier.\nBIP 44/49/84 Support\nThe change to using descriptors changes the default derivation paths used by Bitcoin Core\nto adhere to BIP 44/49/84. Descriptors with different derivation paths can be imported without\nissue.\nSQLite Database Backend\nDescriptor wallets use SQLite for the wallet file instead of the Berkeley DB used in legacy wallets.\nThis will break compatibility with any existing tooling that operates on wallets, however compatibility\nwas already being broken by the move to descriptors.\nWallet RPC changes\n\n\nThe upgradewallet RPC replaces the -upgradewallet command line option.\n(#15761)\n\n\nThe settxfee RPC will fail if the fee was set higher than the -maxtxfee\ncommand line setting. The wallet will already fail to create transactions\nwith fees higher than -maxtxfee. (#18467)\n\n\nA new fee_rate parameter/option denominated in satoshis per vbyte (sat/vB)\nis introduced to the sendtoaddress, sendmany, fundrawtransaction and\nwalletcreatefundedpsbt RPCs as well as to the experimental new send\nRPC. The legacy feeRate option in fundrawtransaction and\nwalletcreatefundedpsbt still exists for setting a fee rate in BTC per 1,000\nvbytes (BTC/kvB), but it is expected to be deprecated soon to avoid\nconfusion. For these RPCs, the fee rate error message is updated from BTC/kB\nto sat/vB and the help documentation in BTC/kB is updated to BTC/kvB. The\nsend and sendtoaddress RPC examples are updated to aid users in creating\ntransactions with explicit fee rates. (#20305, #11413)\n\n\nThe bumpfee RPC fee_rate option is changed from BTC/kvB to sat/vB and the\nhelp documentation is updated. Users are warned that this is a breaking API\nchange, but it should be relatively benign: the large (100,000 times)\ndifference between BTC/kvB and sat/vB units means that a transaction with a\nfee rate mistakenly calculated in BTC/kvB rather than sat/vB should raise an\nerror due to the fee rate being set too low. In the worst case, the\ntransaction may send at 1 sat/vB, but as Replace-by-Fee (BIP125 RBF) is active\nby default when an explicit fee rate is used, the transaction fee can be\nbumped. (#20305)\n\n\nGUI changes\n\n\nWallets created or loaded in the GUI will now be automatically loaded on\nstartup, so they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to be manually reloaded next time Bitcoin Core is\nstarted. The list of wallets to load on startup is stored in\n\\<datadir\\>/settings.json and augments any command line or bitcoin.conf\n-wallet= settings that specify more wallets to load. Wallets that are\nunloaded in the GUI get removed from the settings list so they won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t load\nagain automatically next startup. (#19754)\n\n\nThe GUI Peers window no longer displays a \u00e2\u0080\u009cBan Score\u00e2\u0080\u009d field. This is part of\nchanges in 0.20.1 and in this release to the handling of misbehaving\npeers. Refer to \u00e2\u0080\u009cChanges regarding misbehaving peers\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the 0.20.1 release\nnotes for details.

Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt</code> (on Mac)\nor <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoind</code>/<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin-qt</code> (on Linux).</p>\n<p>Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\npossible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\nwallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.</p>\n<h1 id=\"compatibility\">Compatibility</h1>\n<p>Bitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\nusing the Linux kernel, macOS 10.12+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Bitcoin\nCore should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\nfrequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\nunsupported systems.</p>\n<p>From Bitcoin Core 0.20.0 onwards, macOS versions earlier than 10.12 are no\nlonger supported. Additionally, Bitcoin Core does not yet change appearance\nwhen macOS \u00e2\u0080\u009cdark mode\u00e2\u0080\u009d is activated.</p>\n<p>The node\u00e2\u0080\u0099s known peers are persisted to disk in a file called <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">peers.dat</code>. The\nformat of this file has been changed in a backwards-incompatible way in order to\naccommodate the storage of Tor v3 and other BIP155 addresses. This means that if\nthe file is modified by 0.21.0 or newer then older versions will not be able to\nread it. Those old versions, in the event of a downgrade, will log an error\nmessage \u00e2\u0080\u009cIncorrect keysize in addrman deserialization\u00e2\u0080\u009d and will continue normal\noperation as if the file was missing, creating a new empty one. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19954\">#19954</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20284\">#20284</a>)</p>\n<h1 id=\"notable-changes\">Notable changes</h1>\n<h2 id=\"p2p-and-network-changes\">P2P and network changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The mempool now tracks whether transactions submitted via the wallet or RPCs\nhave been successfully broadcast. Every 10-15 minutes, the node will try to\nannounce unbroadcast transactions until a peer requests it via a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getdata</code>\nmessage or the transaction is removed from the mempool for other reasons.\nThe node will not track the broadcast status of transactions submitted to the\nnode using P2P relay. This version reduces the initial broadcast guarantees\nfor wallet transactions submitted via P2P to a node running the wallet. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18038\">#18038</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The size of the set of transactions that peers have announced and we consider\nfor requests has been reduced from 100000 to 5000 (per peer), and further\nannouncements will be ignored when that limit is reached. If you need to dump\n(very) large batches of transactions, exceptions can be made for trusted\npeers using the \u00e2\u0080\u009crelay\u00e2\u0080\u009d network permission. For localhost for example it can\nbe enabled using the command line option <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-whitelist=relay@127.0.0.1</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19988\">#19988</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This release adds support for Tor version 3 hidden services, and rumoring them\nover the network to other peers using\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0155.mediawiki\">BIP155</a>.\nVersion 2 hidden services are still fully supported by Bitcoin Core, but the\nTor network will start\n<a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/v2-deprecation-timeline\">deprecating</a> them in the\ncoming months. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19954\">#19954</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Tor onion service that is automatically created by setting the\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-listenonion</code> configuration parameter will now be created as a Tor v3 service\ninstead of Tor v2. The private key that was used for Tor v2 (if any) will be\nleft untouched in the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">onion_private_key</code> file in the data directory (see\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-datadir</code>) and can be removed if not needed. Bitcoin Core will no longer\nattempt to read it. The private key for the Tor v3 service will be saved in a\nfile named <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">onion_v3_private_key</code>. To use the deprecated Tor v2 service (not\nrecommended), the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">onion_private_key</code> can be copied over\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">onion_v3_private_key</code>, e.g.\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">cp -f onion_private_key onion_v3_private_key</code>. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19954\">#19954</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The client writes a file (<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">anchors.dat</code>) at shutdown with the network addresses\nof the node\u00e2\u0080\u0099s two outbound block-relay-only peers (so called \u00e2\u0080\u009canchors\u00e2\u0080\u009d). The\nnext time the node starts, it reads this file and attempts to reconnect to those\nsame two peers. This prevents an attacker from using node restarts to trigger a\ncomplete change in peers, which would be something they could use as part of an\neclipse attack. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17428\">#17428</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This release adds support for serving\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0157.mediawiki\">BIP157</a> compact\nfilters to peers on the network when enabled using\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-blockfilterindex=1 -peerblockfilters=1</code>. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16442\">#16442</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This release adds support for signets\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0325.mediawiki\">BIP325</a>) in\naddition to the existing mainnet, testnet, and regtest networks. Signets are\ncentrally-controlled test networks, allowing them to be more predictable\ntest environments than the older testnet. One public signet is maintained, and\nselectable using <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-signet</code>. It is also possible to create personal signets.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18267\">#18267</a>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This release implements\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0339.mediawiki\">BIP339</a>\nwtxid relay. When negotiated, transactions are announced using their wtxid\ninstead of their txid. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18044\">#18044</a>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This release implements the proposed Taproot consensus rules\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki\">BIP341</a> and\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0342.mediawiki\">BIP342</a>),\nwithout activation on mainnet. Experimentation with Taproot can be done on\nsignet, where its rules are already active.

(<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20002\">#20002</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getpeerinfo</code> RPC now has additional <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">last_block</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">last_transaction</code>\nfields that return the UNIX epoch time of the last block and the last <em>valid</em>\ntransaction received from each peer. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19731\">#19731</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getnetworkinfo</code> now returns two new fields, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">connections_in</code> and\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">connections_out</code>, that provide the number of inbound and outbound peer\nconnections. These new fields are in addition to the existing <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">connections</code>\nfield, which returns the total number of peer connections. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19405\">#19405</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Exposed transaction version numbers are now treated as unsigned 32-bit\nintegers instead of signed 32-bit integers. This matches their treatment in\nconsensus logic. Versions greater than 2 continue to be non-standard\n(matching previous behavior of smaller than 1 or greater than 2 being\nnon-standard). Note that this includes the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">joinpsbt</code> command, which combines\npartially-signed transactions by selecting the highest version number.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16525\">#16525</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getmempoolinfo</code> now returns an additional <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">unbroadcastcount</code> field.

This indicates\nwhether initial broadcast of the transaction has been acknowledged by a\npeer. <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getmempoolancestors</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getmempooldescendants</code> are also updated.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getpeerinfo</code> RPC no longer returns the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">banscore</code> field unless the configuration\noption <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-deprecatedrpc=banscore</code> is used. The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">banscore</code> field will be fully\nremoved in the next major release. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19469\">#19469</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">testmempoolaccept</code> RPC returns <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">vsize</code> and a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">fees</code> object with the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">base</code> fee\nif the transaction would pass validation. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19940\">#19940</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getpeerinfo</code> RPC now returns a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">connection_type</code> field.

Additionally there may be some bugs and current functions may change in the future.\nBugs and missing functionality can be reported to the <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues\">issue tracker</a>.</p>\n<p>0.21 introduces a new type of wallet - Descriptor Wallets. Descriptor Wallets store\nscriptPubKey information using output descriptors. This is in contrast to the Legacy Wallet\nstructure where keys are used to implicitly generate scriptPubKeys and addresses. Because of this\nshift to being script based instead of key based, many of the confusing things that Legacy\nWallets do are not possible with Descriptor Wallets. Descriptor Wallets use a definition\nof \u00e2\u0080\u009cmine\u00e2\u0080\u009d for scripts which is simpler and more intuitive than that used by Legacy Wallets.\nDescriptor Wallets also uses different semantics for watch-only things and imports.</p>\n<p>As Descriptor Wallets are a new type of wallet, their introduction does not affect existing wallets.\nUsers who already have a Bitcoin Core wallet can continue to use it as they did before without\nany change in behavior. Newly created Legacy Wallets (which remains the default type of wallet) will\nbehave as they did in previous versions of Bitcoin Core.</p>\n<p>The differences between Descriptor Wallets and Legacy Wallets are largely limited to non user facing\nthings. They are intended to behave similarly except for the import/export and watchonly functionality\nas described below.</p>\n<h4 id=\"creating-descriptor-wallets\">Creating Descriptor Wallets</h4>\n<p>Descriptor wallets are not the default type of wallet.</p>\n<p>In the GUI, a checkbox has been added to the Create Wallet Dialog to indicate that a\nDescriptor Wallet should be created. And a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">descriptors</code> option has been added to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">createwallet</code> RPC.\nSetting <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">descriptors</code> to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">true</code> will create a Descriptor Wallet instead of a Legacy Wallet.</p>\n<p>Without those options being set, a Legacy Wallet will be created instead.</p>\n<h4 id=\"ismine-semantics\"><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">IsMine</code> Semantics</h4>\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">IsMine</code> refers to the function used to determine whether a script belongs to the wallet.\nThis is used to determine whether an output belongs to the wallet. <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">IsMine</code> in Legacy Wallets\nreturns true if the wallet would be able to sign an input that spends an output with that script.\nSince keys can be involved in a variety of different scripts, this definition for <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">IsMine</code> can\nlead to many unexpected scripts being considered part of the wallet.</p>\n<p>With Descriptor Wallets, descriptors explicitly specify the set of scripts that are owned by\nthe wallet. Since descriptors are deterministic and easily enumerable, users will know exactly\nwhat scripts the wallet will consider to belong to it. Additionally the implementation of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">IsMine</code>\nin Descriptor Wallets is far simpler than for Legacy Wallets. Notably, in Legacy Wallets, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">IsMine</code>\nallowed for users to take one type of address (e.g. P2PKH), mutate it into another address type\n(e.g. P2WPKH), and the wallet would still detect outputs sending to the new address type\neven without that address being requested from the wallet. Descriptor Wallets do not\nallow for this and will only watch for the addresses that were explicitly requested from the wallet.</p>\n<p>These changes to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">IsMine</code> will make it easier to reason about what scripts the wallet will\nactually be watching for in outputs. However for the vast majority of users, this change is\nlargely transparent and will not have noticeable effect.</p>\n<h4 id=\"imports-and-exports\">Imports and Exports</h4>\n<p>In Legacy Wallets, raw scripts and keys could be imported to the wallet. Those imported scripts\nand keys are treated separately from the keys generated by the wallet. This complicates the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">IsMine</code>\nlogic as it has to distinguish between spendable and watchonly.</p>\n<p>Descriptor Wallets handle importing scripts and keys differently. Only complete descriptors can be\nimported. These descriptors are then added to the wallet as if it were a descriptor generated by\nthe wallet itself. This simplifies the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">IsMine</code> logic so that it no longer has to distinguish\nbetween spendable and watchonly. As such, the watchonly model for Descriptor Wallets is also\ndifferent and described in more detail in the next section.</p>\n<p>To import into a Descriptor Wallet, a new <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">importdescriptors</code> RPC has been added that uses a syntax\nsimilar to that of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">importmulti</code>.</p>\n<p>As Legacy Wallets and Descriptor Wallets use different mechanisms for storing and importing scripts and keys\nthe existing import RPCs have been disabled for descriptor wallets.\nNew export RPCs for Descriptor Wallets have not yet been added.</p>\n<p>The following RPCs are disabled for Descriptor Wallets:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">importprivkey</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">importpubkey</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">importaddress</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">importwallet</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">dumpprivkey</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">dumpwallet</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">importmulti</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">addmultisigaddress</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">sethdseed</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"watchonly-wallets\">Watchonly Wallets</h4>\n<p>A Legacy Wallet contains both private keys and scripts that were being watched.\nThose watched scripts would not contribute to your normal balance. In order to see the watchonly\nbalance and to use watchonly things in transactions, an <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">include_watchonly</code> option was added\nto many RPCs that would allow users to do that. However it is easy to forget to include this option.</p>\n<p>Descriptor Wallets move to a per-wallet watchonly model. Instead an entire wallet is considered to be\nwatchonly depending on whether it was created with private keys disabled. This eliminates the need\nto distinguish between things that are watchonly and things that are not within a wallet itself.</p>\n<p>This change does have a caveat. If a Descriptor Wallet with private keys <em>enabled</em> has\na multiple key descriptor without all of the private keys (e.g. <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">multi(...)</code> with only one private key),\nthen the wallet will fail to sign and broadcast transactions. Such wallets would need to use the PSBT\nworkflow but the typical GUI Send, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">sendtoaddress</code>, etc. workflows would still be available, just\nnon-functional.</p>\n<p>This issue is worsened if the wallet contains both single key (e.g. <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">wpkh(...)</code>) descriptors and such\nmultiple key descriptors as some transactions could be signed and broadcast and others not. This is\ndue to some transactions containing only single key inputs, while others would contain both single\nkey and multiple key inputs, depending on which are available and how the coin selection algorithm\nselects inputs. However this is not considered to be a supported use case; multisigs\nshould be in their own wallets which do not already have descriptors. Although users cannot export\ndescriptors with private keys for now as explained earlier.</p>\n<h4 id=\"bip-444984-support\">BIP 44/49/84 Support</h4>\n<p>The change to using descriptors changes the default derivation paths used by Bitcoin Core\nto adhere to BIP 44/49/84. Descriptors with different derivation paths can be imported without\nissue.</p>\n<h4 id=\"sqlite-database-backend\">SQLite Database Backend</h4>\n<p>Descriptor wallets use SQLite for the wallet file instead of the Berkeley DB used in legacy wallets.\nThis will break compatibility with any existing tooling that operates on wallets, however compatibility\nwas already being broken by the move to descriptors.</p>\n<h3 id=\"wallet-rpc-changes\">Wallet RPC changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">upgradewallet</code> RPC replaces the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-upgradewallet</code> command line option.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15761\">#15761</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">settxfee</code> RPC will fail if the fee was set higher than the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-maxtxfee</code>\ncommand line setting. The wallet will already fail to create transactions\nwith fees higher than <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-maxtxfee</code>. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18467\">#18467</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A new <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">fee_rate</code> parameter/option denominated in satoshis per vbyte (sat/vB)\nis introduced to the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">sendtoaddress</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">sendmany</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">fundrawtransaction</code> and\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">walletcreatefundedpsbt</code> RPCs as well as to the experimental new <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">send</code>\nRPC. The legacy <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">feeRate</code> option in <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">fundrawtransaction</code> and\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">walletcreatefundedpsbt</code> still exists for setting a fee rate in BTC per 1,000\nvbytes (BTC/kvB), but it is expected to be deprecated soon to avoid\nconfusion. For these RPCs, the fee rate error message is updated from BTC/kB\nto sat/vB and the help documentation in BTC/kB is updated to BTC/kvB. The\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">send</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">sendtoaddress</code> RPC examples are updated to aid users in creating\ntransactions with explicit fee rates. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20305\">#20305</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11413\">#11413</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bumpfee</code> RPC <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">fee_rate</code> option is changed from BTC/kvB to sat/vB and the\nhelp documentation is updated. Users are warned that this is a breaking API\nchange, but it should be relatively benign: the large (100,000 times)\ndifference between BTC/kvB and sat/vB units means that a transaction with a\nfee rate mistakenly calculated in BTC/kvB rather than sat/vB should raise an\nerror due to the fee rate being set too low. In the worst case, the\ntransaction may send at 1 sat/vB, but as Replace-by-Fee (BIP125 RBF) is active\nby default when an explicit fee rate is used, the transaction fee can be\nbumped.

Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac)\nor bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).\nUpgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\npossible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\nwallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\nCompatibility\nBitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\nusing the Linux kernel, macOS 10.12+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Bitcoin\nCore should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\nfrequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\nunsupported systems.\nFrom Bitcoin Core 0.20.0 onwards, macOS versions earlier than 10.12 are no\nlonger supported. Additionally, Bitcoin Core does not yet change appearance\nwhen macOS \u00e2\u0080\u009cdark mode\u00e2\u0080\u009d is activated.\nKnown Bugs\nThe process for generating the source code release (\u00e2\u0080\u009ctarball\u00e2\u0080\u009d) has changed in an\neffort to make it more complete, however, there are a few regressions in\nthis release:\n\n\nThe generated configure script is currently missing, and you will need to\ninstall autotools and run ./autogen.sh before you can run\n./configure. This is the same as when checking out from git.\n\n\nInstead of running make simply, you should instead run\nBITCOIN_GENBUILD_NO_GIT=1 make.\n\n\nNotable changes\nChanges regarding misbehaving peers\nPeers that misbehave (e.g. send us invalid blocks) are now referred to as\ndiscouraged nodes in log output, as they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not (and weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t) strictly banned:\nincoming connections are still allowed from them, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re preferred for\neviction.\nFurthermore, a few additional changes are introduced to how discouraged\naddresses are treated:\n\n\nDiscouraging an address does not time out automatically after 24 hours\n(or the -bantime setting). Depending on traffic from other peers,\ndiscouragement may time out at an indeterminate time.\n\n\nDiscouragement is not persisted over restarts.\n\n\nThere is no method to list discouraged addresses. They are not returned by\nthe listbanned RPC. That RPC also no longer reports the ban_reason\nfield, as \"manually added\" is the only remaining option.\n\n\nDiscouragement cannot be removed with the setban remove RPC command.\nIf you need to remove a discouragement, you can remove all discouragements by\nstop-starting your node.\n\n\nNotification changes\n-walletnotify notifications are now sent for wallet transactions that are\nremoved from the mempool because they conflict with a new block. These\nnotifications were sent previously before the v0.19 release, but had been\nbroken since that release (bug #18325).\nPSBT changes\nPSBTs will contain both the non-witness utxo and the witness utxo for segwit\ninputs in order to restore compatibility with wallet software that are now\nrequiring the full previous transaction for segwit inputs. The witness utxo\nis still provided to maintain compatibility with software which relied on its\nexistence to determine whether an input was segwit.\n0.20.2 change log\nP2P protocol and network code\n\n#19620 Add txids with non-standard inputs to reject filter (sdaftuar)\n#20146 Send post-verack handshake messages at most once (MarcoFalke)\n\nWallet\n\n#19740 Simplify and fix CWallet::SignTransaction (achow101)\n\nRPC and other APIs\n\n#19836 Properly deserialize txs with witness before signing (MarcoFalke)\n#20731 Add missing description of vout in getrawtransaction help text (benthecarman)\n\nBuild system\n\n#20142 build: set minimum required Boost to 1.48.0 (fanquake)\n#20298 use the new plistlib API (jonasschnelli)\n#20880 gitian: Use custom MacOS code signing tool (achow101)\n#22190 Use latest signapple commit (achow101)\n\nTests and QA\n\n#19839 Set appveyor vm version to previous Visual Studio 2019 release.

Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac)\nor bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).\nUpgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\npossible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\nwallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\nCompatibility\nBitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\nusing the Linux kernel, macOS 10.12+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Bitcoin\nCore should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\nfrequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\nunsupported systems.\nFrom Bitcoin Core 0.20.0 onwards, macOS versions earlier than 10.12 are no\nlonger supported. Additionally, Bitcoin Core does not yet change appearance\nwhen macOS \u00e2\u0080\u009cdark mode\u00e2\u0080\u009d is activated.\nKnown Bugs\nThe process for generating the source code release (\u00e2\u0080\u009ctarball\u00e2\u0080\u009d) has changed in an\neffort to make it more complete, however, there are a few regressions in\nthis release:\n\n\nThe generated configure script is currently missing, and you will need to\ninstall autotools and run ./autogen.sh before you can run\n./configure. This is the same as when checking out from git.\n\n\nInstead of running make simply, you should instead run\nBITCOIN_GENBUILD_NO_GIT=1 make.\n\n\nNotable changes\nChanges regarding misbehaving peers\nPeers that misbehave (e.g. send us invalid blocks) are now referred to as\ndiscouraged nodes in log output, as they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not (and weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t) strictly banned:\nincoming connections are still allowed from them, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re preferred for\neviction.\nFurthermore, a few additional changes are introduced to how discouraged\naddresses are treated:\n\n\nDiscouraging an address does not time out automatically after 24 hours\n(or the -bantime setting). Depending on traffic from other peers,\ndiscouragement may time out at an indeterminate time.\n\n\nDiscouragement is not persisted over restarts.\n\n\nThere is no method to list discouraged addresses. They are not returned by\nthe listbanned RPC. That RPC also no longer reports the ban_reason\nfield, as \"manually added\" is the only remaining option.\n\n\nDiscouragement cannot be removed with the setban remove RPC command.\nIf you need to remove a discouragement, you can remove all discouragements by\nstop-starting your node.\n\n\nNotification changes\n-walletnotify notifications are now sent for wallet transactions that are\nremoved from the mempool because they conflict with a new block. These\nnotifications were sent previously before the v0.19 release, but had been\nbroken since that release (bug\n#18325).\nPSBT changes\nPSBTs will contain both the non-witness utxo and the witness utxo for segwit\ninputs in order to restore compatibility with wallet software that are now\nrequiring the full previous transaction for segwit inputs. The witness utxo\nis still provided to maintain compatibility with software which relied on its\nexistence to determine whether an input was segwit.\n0.20.1 change log\nMining\n\n#19019 Fix GBT:

Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac)\nor bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).\nUpgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\npossible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\nwallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\nCompatibility\nBitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\nusing the Linux kernel, macOS 10.12+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Bitcoin\nCore should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\nfrequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\nunsupported systems.\nFrom Bitcoin Core 0.20.0 onwards, macOS versions earlier than 10.12 are no\nlonger supported. Additionally, Bitcoin Core does not yet change appearance\nwhen macOS \u00e2\u0080\u009cdark mode\u00e2\u0080\u009d is activated.\nKnown Bugs\nThe process for generating the source code release (\u00e2\u0080\u009ctarball\u00e2\u0080\u009d) has changed in an\neffort to make it more complete, however, there are a few regressions in\nthis release:\n\n\nThe generated configure script is currently missing, and you will need to\ninstall autotools and run ./autogen.sh before you can run\n./configure. This is the same as when checking out from git.\n\n\nInstead of running make simply, you should instead run\nBITCOIN_GENBUILD_NO_GIT=1 make.\n\n\nNotable changes\nP2P and network changes\nRemoval of BIP61 reject network messages from Bitcoin Core\nThe -enablebip61 command line option to enable BIP61 has been removed.\n(#17004)\nThis feature has been disabled by default since Bitcoin Core version 0.18.0.\nNodes on the network can not generally be trusted to send valid messages\n(including reject messages), so this should only ever be used when\nconnected to a trusted node.  Please use the alternatives recommended\nbelow if you rely on this removed feature:\n\n\nTesting or debugging of implementations of the Bitcoin P2P network protocol\nshould be done by inspecting the log messages that are produced by a recent\nversion of Bitcoin Core. Bitcoin Core logs debug messages\n(-debug=<category>) to a stream (-printtoconsole) or to a file\n(-debuglogfile=<debug.log>).\n\n\nTesting the validity of a block can be achieved by specific RPCs:\n\n\nsubmitblock\n\n\ngetblocktemplate with 'mode' set to 'proposal' for blocks with\npotentially invalid POW\n\n\n\n\nTesting the validity of a transaction can be achieved by specific RPCs:\n\n\nsendrawtransaction\n\n\ntestmempoolaccept\n\n\n\n\nWallets should not assume a transaction has propagated to the network\njust because there are no reject messages.  Instead, listen for the\ntransaction to be announced by other peers on the network.  Wallets\nshould not assume a lack of reject messages means a transaction pays\nan appropriate fee.  Instead, set fees using fee estimation and use\nreplace-by-fee to increase a transaction\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fee if it hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t confirmed\nwithin the desired amount of time.\n\n\nThe removal of BIP61 reject message support also has the following minor RPC\nand logging implications:\n\n\ntestmempoolaccept and sendrawtransaction no longer return the P2P reject\ncode when a transaction is not accepted to the mempool. They still return the\nverbal reject reason.\n\n\nLog messages that previously reported the reject code when a transaction was\nnot accepted to the mempool now no longer report the reject code. The reason\nfor rejection is still reported.\n\n\nUpdated RPCs\n\n\nThe RPCs which accept descriptors now accept the new sortedmulti(...) descriptor\ntype which supports multisig scripts where the public keys are sorted\nlexicographically in the resulting script.  (#17056)\n\n\nThe walletprocesspsbt and walletcreatefundedpsbt RPCs now include\nBIP32 derivation paths by default for public keys if we know them.\nThis can be disabled by setting the bip32derivs parameter to\nfalse.  (#17264)\n\n\nThe bumpfee RPC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s parameter totalFee, which was deprecated in\n0.19, has been removed.  (#18312)\n\n\nThe bumpfee RPC will return a PSBT when used with wallets that have\nprivate keys disabled.  (#16373)\n\n\nThe getpeerinfo RPC now includes a mapped_as field to indicate the\nmapped Autonomous System used for diversifying peer selection. See the\n-asmap configuration option described below in New Settings.  (#16702)\n\n\nThe createmultisig and addmultisigaddress RPCs now return an\noutput script descriptor for the newly created address.  (#18032)\n\n\nBuild System\n\n\nOpenSSL is no longer used by Bitcoin Core.  (#17265)\n\n\nBIP70 support has been fully removed from Bitcoin Core. The\n--enable-bip70 option remains, but it will throw an error during configure.\n(#17165)\n\n\nglibc 2.17 or greater is now required to run the release binaries. This\nretains compatibility with RHEL 7, CentOS 7, Debian 8 and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (#17538)\n\n\nThe source code archives that are provided with gitian builds no longer contain\nany autotools artifacts. Therefore, to build from such source, a user\nshould run the ./autogen.sh script from the root of the unpacked archive.\nThis implies that autotools and other required packages are installed on the\nuser\u00e2\u0080\u0099s system. (#18331)\n\n\nNew settings\n\n\nNew rpcwhitelist and rpcwhitelistdefault configuration parameters\nallow giving certain RPC users permissions to only some RPC calls.\n(#12763)\n\n\nA new -asmap configuration option has been added to diversify the\nnode\u00e2\u0080\u0099s network connections by mapping IP addresses Autonomous System\nNumbers (ASNs) and then limiting the number of connections made to any\nsingle ASN.  See issue #16599,\nPR #16702, and the\nbitcoind help for more information.  This option is experimental and\nsubject to removal or breaking changes in future releases, so the\nlegacy /16 prefix mapping of IP addresses remains the default.  (#16702)\n\n\nUpdated settings\n\n\nAll custom settings configured when Bitcoin Core starts are now\nwritten to the debug.log file to assist troubleshooting.  (#16115)\n\n\nImporting blocks upon startup via the bootstrap.dat file no longer\noccurs by default. The file must now be specified with\n-loadblock=<file>.  (#17044)\n\n\nThe -debug=db logging category has been renamed to\n-debug=walletdb to distinguish it from coindb.  The -debug=db\noption has been deprecated and will be removed in the next major\nrelease.  (#17410)\n\n\nThe -walletnotify configuration parameter will now replace any %w\nin its argument with the name of the wallet generating the\nnotification.  This is not supported on Windows. (#13339)\n\n\nRemoved settings\n\nThe -whitelistforcerelay configuration parameter has been removed after\nit was discovered that it was rendered ineffective in version 0.13 and\nhasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t actually been supported for almost four years.  (#17985)\n\nGUI changes\n\n\nThe \u00e2\u0080\u009cStart Bitcoin Core on system login\u00e2\u0080\u009d option has been removed on macOS.\n(#17567)\n\n\nIn the Peers window, the details for a peer now displays a Mapped AS\nfield to indicate the mapped Autonomous System used for diversifying\npeer selection. See the -asmap configuration option in New\nSettings, above.  (#18402)\n\n\nA \u00e2\u0080\u009cknown bug\u00e2\u0080\u009d announced\nin the release notes of version 0.18 has been fixed.  The issue\naffected anyone who simultaneously used multiple Bitcoin Core wallets\nand the GUI coin control feature. (#18894)\n\n\nFor watch-only wallets, creating a new transaction in the Send screen\nor fee bumping an existing transaction in the Transactions screen will\nautomatically copy a Partially-Signed Bitcoin Transaction (PSBT) to\nthe system clipboard.  This can then be pasted into an external\nprogram such as HWI for\nsigning.  Future versions of Bitcoin Core should support a GUI option\nfor finalizing and broadcasting PSBTs, but for now the debug console\nmay be used with the finalizepsbt and sendrawtransaction RPCs.\n(#16944, #17492)\n\n\nWallet\n\n\nThe wallet now by default uses bech32 addresses when using RPC, and\ncreates native segwit change outputs.  (#16884)\n\n\nThe way that output trust was computed has been fixed, which affects\nconfirmed/unconfirmed balance status and coin selection.  (#16766)\n\n\nThe gettransaction, listtransactions and listsinceblock RPC\nresponses now also include the height of the block that contains the\nwallet transaction, if any.  (#17437)\n\n\nThe getaddressinfo RPC has had its label field deprecated\n(re-enable for this release using the configuration parameter\n-deprecatedrpc=label).  The labels field is altered from returning\nJSON objects to returning a JSON array of label names (re-enable\nprevious behavior for this release using the configuration parameter\n-deprecatedrpc=labelspurpose).  Backwards compatibility using the\ndeprecated configuration parameters is expected to be dropped in the\n0.21 release.  (#17585, #17578)\n\n\nDocumentation changes\n\nBitcoin Core\u00e2\u0080\u0099s automatically-generated source code documentation is\nnow available at https://doxygen.bitcoincore.org.  (#17596)\n\nLow-level changes\nUtilities\n\n\nThe bitcoin-cli utility used with the -getinfo parameter now\nreturns a headers field with the number of downloaded block headers\non the best headers chain (similar to the blocks field that is also\nreturned) and a verificationprogress field that estimates how much\nof the best block chain has been synced by the local node.  The\ninformation returned no longer includes the protocolversion,\nwalletversion, and keypoololdest fields.  (#17302, #17650)\n\n\nThe bitcoin-cli utility now accepts a -stdinwalletpassphrase\nparameter that can be used when calling the walletpassphrase and\nwalletpassphrasechange RPCs to read the passphrase from standard\ninput without echoing it to the terminal, improving security against\nanyone who can look at your screen.  The existing -stdinrpcpass\nparameter is also updated to not echo the passphrase. (#13716)\n\n\nCommand line\n\nCommand line options prefixed with main/test/regtest network names like\n-main.port=8333 -test.server=1 previously were allowed but ignored. Now\nthey trigger \u00e2\u0080\u009cInvalid parameter\u00e2\u0080\u009d errors on startup. (#17482)\n\nNew RPCs\n\n\nThe dumptxoutset RPC outputs a serialized snapshot of the current\nUTXO set.  A script is provided in the contrib/devtools directory\nfor generating a snapshot of the UTXO set at a particular block\nheight.  (#16899)\n\n\nThe generatetodescriptor RPC allows testers using regtest mode to\ngenerate blocks that pay an arbitrary output script descriptor.\n(#16943)\n\n\nUpdated RPCs\n\n\nThe verifychain RPC default values are now static instead of\ndepending on the command line options or configuration file\n(-checklevel, and -checkblocks). Users can pass in the RPC\narguments explicitly when they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to rely on the default\nvalues. (#18541)\n\n\nThe getblockchaininfo RPC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s verificationprogress field will no\nlonger report values higher than 1.  Previously it would occasionally\nreport the chain was more than 100% verified.  (#17328)\n\n\nTests\n\n\nIt is now an error to use an unqualified walletdir=path setting in\nthe config file if running on testnet or regtest networks. The setting\nnow needs to be qualified as chain.walletdir=path or placed in the\nappropriate [chain] section. (#17447)\n\n\n-fallbackfee was 0 (disabled) by default for the main chain, but\n0.0002 by default for the test chains. Now it is 0 by default for all\nchains. Testnet and regtest users will have to add\nfallbackfee=0.0002 to their configuration if they weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t setting it\nand they want it to keep working like before.

Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt</code> (on Mac)\nor <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoind</code>/<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin-qt</code> (on Linux).</p>\n<p>Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\npossible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\nwallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.</p>\n<h1 id=\"compatibility\">Compatibility</h1>\n<p>Bitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\nusing the Linux kernel, macOS 10.12+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Bitcoin\nCore should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\nfrequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\nunsupported systems.</p>\n<p>From Bitcoin Core 0.20.0 onwards, macOS versions earlier than 10.12 are no\nlonger supported.

Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac)\nor bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).\nUpgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\npossible, but it might take some time if the datadir needs to be migrated. Old\nwallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\nCompatibility\nBitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems using\nthe Linux kernel, macOS 10.10+, and Windows 7 and newer. It is not recommended\nto use Bitcoin Core on unsupported systems.\nBitcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not\nas frequently tested on them.\nFrom Bitcoin Core 0.17.0 onwards, macOS versions earlier than 10.10 are no\nlonger supported, as Bitcoin Core is now built using Qt 5.9.x which requires\nmacOS 10.10+. Additionally, Bitcoin Core does not yet change appearance when\nmacOS \u00e2\u0080\u009cdark mode\u00e2\u0080\u009d is activated.\nIn addition to previously supported CPU platforms, this release\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pre-compiled\ndistribution provides binaries for the RISC-V platform.\n0.19.1 change log\nWallet\n\n#17643 Fix origfee return for bumpfee with feerate arg

This is due to new signing requirements\nimposed by Apple, which the Bitcoin Core project does not yet adhere too.\nNotable changes\nNew user documentation\n\nReduce memory\nsuggests configuration tweaks for running Bitcoin Core on systems with\nlimited memory. (#16339)\n\nNew RPCs\n\n\ngetbalances returns an object with all balances (mine,\nuntrusted_pending and immature). Please refer to the RPC help of\ngetbalances for details. The new RPC is intended to replace\ngetbalance, getunconfirmedbalance, and the balance fields in\ngetwalletinfo.  These old calls and fields may be removed in a\nfuture version. (#15930, #16239)\n\n\nsetwalletflag sets and unsets wallet flags that enable or disable\nfeatures specific to that existing wallet, such as the new\navoid_reuse feature documented elsewhere in these release notes.\n(#13756)\n\n\ngetblockfilter gets the BIP158 filter for the specified block.  This\nRPC is only enabled if block filters have been created using the\n-blockfilterindex configuration option. (#14121)\n\n\nNew settings\n\n-blockfilterindex enables the creation of BIP158 block filters for\nthe entire blockchain.  Filters will be created in the background and\ncurrently use about 4 GiB of space.  Note: this version of Bitcoin\nCore does not serve block filters over the P2P network, although the\nlocal user may obtain block filters using the getblockfilter RPC.\n(#14121)\n\nUpdated settings\n\n\nwhitebind and whitelist now accept a list of permissions to\nprovide peers connecting using the indicated interfaces or IP\naddresses.  If no permissions are specified with an address or CIDR\nnetwork, the implicit default permissions are the same as previous\nreleases.  See the bitcoind -help output for these two options for\ndetails about the available permissions. (#16248)\n\n\nUsers setting custom dbcache values can increase their setting slightly\nwithout using any more real memory.  Recent changes reduced the memory use\nby about 9% and made chainstate accounting more accurate (it was underestimating\nthe use of memory before).  For example, if you set a value of \u00e2\u0080\u009c450\u00e2\u0080\u009d before, you\nmay now set a value of \u00e2\u0080\u009c500\u00e2\u0080\u009d to use about the same real amount of memory. (#16957)\n\n\nUpdated RPCs\nNote: some low-level RPC changes mainly useful for testing are described in the\nLow-level Changes section below.\n\n\nsendmany no longer has a minconf argument.  This argument was not\nwell-specified and would lead to RPC errors even when the wallet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ncoin selection succeeded.  Users who want to influence coin selection\ncan use the existing -spendzeroconfchange, -limitancestorcount,\n-limitdescendantcount and -walletrejectlongchains configuration\narguments. (#15596)\n\n\ngetbalance and sendtoaddress, plus the new RPCs getbalances and\ncreatewallet, now accept an \u00e2\u0080\u009cavoid_reuse\u00e2\u0080\u009d parameter that controls\nwhether already used addresses should be included in the operation.\nAdditionally, sendtoaddress will avoid partial spends when\navoid_reuse is enabled even if this feature is not already enabled\nvia the -avoidpartialspends command line flag because not doing so\nwould risk using up the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwrong\u00e2\u0080\u009d UTXO for an address reuse case.\n(#13756)\n\n\nRPCs which have an include_watchonly argument or includeWatching option now default to true for watch-only\nwallets. Affected RPCs are: getbalance, listreceivedbyaddress, listreceivedbylabel, listtransactions,\nlistsinceblock, gettransaction, walletcreatefundedpsbt, and fundrawtransaction. (#16383)\n\n\nlistunspent now returns a \u00e2\u0080\u009creused\u00e2\u0080\u009d bool for each output if the\nwallet flag \u00e2\u0080\u009cavoid_reuse\u00e2\u0080\u009d is enabled. (#13756)\n\n\ngetblockstats now uses BlockUndo data instead of the transaction\nindex, making it much faster, no longer dependent on the -txindex\nconfiguration option, and functional for all non-pruned blocks.\n(#14802)\n\n\nutxoupdatepsbt now accepts a descriptors parameter that will fill\nout input and output scripts and keys when known. P2SH-witness inputs\nwill be filled in from the UTXO set when a descriptor is provided that\nshows they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re spending segwit outputs.  See the RPC help text for full\ndetails. (#15427)\n\n\nsendrawtransaction and testmempoolaccept no longer accept a\nallowhighfees parameter to fail mempool acceptance if the\ntransaction fee exceeds the value of the configuration option\n-maxtxfee.  Now there is a hardcoded default maximum feerate that\ncan be changed when calling either RPC using a maxfeerate parameter.\n(#15620)\n\n\ngetmempoolancestors, getmempooldescendants, getmempoolentry, and\ngetrawmempool no longer return a size field unless the\nconfiguration option -deprecatedrpc=size is used.  Instead a new\nvsize field is returned with the transaction\u00e2\u0080\u0099s virtual size\n(consistent with other RPCs such as getrawtransaction). (#15637)\n\n\ngetwalletinfo now includes a scanning field that is either false\n(no scanning) or an object with information about the duration and\nprogress of the wallet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s scanning historical blocks for transactions\naffecting its balances. (#15730)\n\n\ngettransaction now accepts a third (boolean) argument verbose. If\nset to true, a new decoded field will be added to the response containing\nthe decoded transaction. This field is equivalent to RPC decoderawtransaction,\nor RPC getrawtransaction when verbose is passed. (#16185, #16866, #16873)\n\n\ncreatewallet accepts a new passphrase parameter.  If set, this\nwill create the new wallet encrypted with the given passphrase.  If\nunset (the default) or set to an empty string, no encryption will be\nused. (#16394)\n\n\ngetchaintxstats RPC now returns the additional key of\nwindow_final_block_height. (#16695)\n\n\ngetmempoolentry now provides a weight field containing the\ntransaction weight as defined in BIP141. (#16647)\n\n\nThe getnetworkinfo and getpeerinfo commands now contain a new field with decoded network service flags. (#16786)\n\n\ngetdescriptorinfo now returns an additional checksum field\ncontaining the checksum for the unmodified descriptor provided by the\nuser (that is, before the descriptor is normalized for the\ndescriptor field). (#15986)\n\n\njoinpsbts now shuffles the order of the inputs and outputs of the resulting\njoined PSBT. Previously, inputs and outputs were added in the order PSBTs were\nprovided. This made it easy to correlate inputs to outputs, representing a\nprivacy leak. (#16512)\n\n\nwalletcreatefundedpsbt now signals BIP125 Replace-by-Fee if the\n-walletrbf configuration option is set to true. (#15911)\n\n\nGUI changes\n\n\nThe GUI wallet now provides bech32 addresses by default.  The user may change the address type\nduring invoice generation using a GUI toggle, or the default address\ntype may be changed with the -addresstype configuration option.\n(#15711, #16497)\n\n\nIn 0.18.0, a ./configure flag was introduced to allow disabling BIP70 support in the GUI (support was enabled by default). In 0.19.0, this flag is now disabled by default. If you want to compile Bitcoin Core with BIP70 support in the GUI, you can pass --enable-bip70 to ./configure. (#15584)\n\n\nDeprecated or removed configuration options\n\n-mempoolreplacement is removed, although default node behavior\nremains the same.  This option previously allowed the user to prevent\nthe node from accepting or relaying BIP125 transaction replacements.\nThis is different from the remaining configuration option\n-walletrbf. (#16171)\n\nDeprecated or removed RPCs\n\n\nbumpfee no longer accepts a totalFee option unless the\nconfiguration parameter deprecatedrpc=totalFee is specified.  This\nparameter will be fully removed in a subsequent release. (#15996)\n\n\nbumpfee has a new fee_rate option as a replacement for the deprecated totalFee. (#16727)\n\n\ngenerate is now removed after being deprecated in Bitcoin Core 0.18.\nUse the generatetoaddress RPC instead. (#15492)\n\n\nP2P changes\n\n\nBIP 61 reject messages were deprecated in v0.18. They are now disabled\nby default, but can be enabled by setting the -enablebip61 command\nline option.  BIP 61 reject messages will be removed entirely in a\nfuture version of Bitcoin Core. (#14054)\n\n\nTo eliminate well-known denial-of-service vectors in Bitcoin Core,\nespecially for nodes with spinning disks, the default value for the\n-peerbloomfilters configuration option has been changed to false.\nThis prevents Bitcoin Core from sending the BIP111 NODE_BLOOM service\nflag, accepting BIP37 bloom filters, or serving merkle blocks or\ntransactions matching a bloom filter.  Users who still want to provide\nbloom filter support may either set the configuration option to true\nto re-enable both BIP111 and BIP37 support or enable just BIP37\nsupport for specific peers using the updated -whitelist and\n-whitebind configuration options described elsewhere in these\nrelease notes.  For the near future, lightweight clients using public\nBIP111/BIP37 nodes should still be able to connect to older versions\nof Bitcoin Core and nodes that have manually enabled BIP37 support,\nbut developers of such software should consider migrating to either\nusing specific BIP37 nodes or an alternative transaction filtering\nsystem. (#16152)\n\n\nBy default, Bitcoin Core will now make two additional outbound connections that are exclusively used for block-relay.  No transactions or addr messages will be processed on these connections. These connections are designed to add little additional memory or bandwidth resource requirements but should make some partitioning attacks more difficult to carry out. (#15759)\n\n\nMiscellaneous CLI Changes\n\nThe testnet field in bitcoin-cli -getinfo has been renamed to\nchain and now returns the current network name as defined in BIP70\n(main, test, regtest). (#15566)\n\nLow-level changes\nRPC\n\n\ngetblockchaininfo no longer returns a bip9_softforks object.\nInstead, information has been moved into the softforks object and\nan additional type field describes how Bitcoin Core determines\nwhether that soft fork is active (e.g. BIP9 or BIP90).  See the RPC\nhelp for details. (#16060)\n\n\ngetblocktemplate no longer returns a rules array containing CSV\nand segwit (the BIP9 deployments that are currently in active\nstate). (#16060)\n\n\ngetrpcinfo now returns a logpath field with the path to\ndebug.log. (#15483)\n\n\nTests\n\nThe regression test chain enabled by the -regtest command line flag\nnow requires transactions to not violate standard policy by default.\nThis is the same default used for mainnet and makes it easier to test\nmainnet behavior on regtest. Note that the testnet still allows\nnon-standard txs by default and that the policy can be locally\nadjusted with the -acceptnonstdtxn command line flag for both test\nchains. (#15891)\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nA setting specified in the default section but not also specified in a\nnetwork-specific section (e.g. testnet) will now produce an error\npreventing startup instead of just a warning unless the network is\nmainnet.  This prevents settings intended for mainnet from being\napplied to testnet or regtest. (#15629)\n\n\nOn platforms supporting thread_local, log lines can be prefixed with\nthe name of the thread that caused the log. To enable this behavior,\nuse -logthreadnames=1. (#15849)\n\n\nNetwork\n\n\nWhen fetching a transaction announced by multiple peers, previous versions of\nBitcoin Core would sequentially attempt to download the transaction from each\nannouncing peer until the transaction is received, in the order that those\npeers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 announcements were received.  In this release, the download logic has\nchanged to randomize the fetch order across peers and to prefer sending\ndownload requests to outbound peers over inbound peers. This fixes an issue\nwhere inbound peers could prevent a node from getting a transaction.\n(#14897, #15834)\n\n\nIf a Tor hidden service is being used, Bitcoin Core will be bound to\nthe standard port 8333 even if a different port is configured for\nclearnet connections.  This prevents leaking node identity through use\nof identical non-default port numbers. (#15651)\n\n\nMempool and transaction relay\n\n\nAllows one extra single-ancestor transaction per package.  Previously,\nif a transaction in the mempool had 25 descendants, or it and all of\nits descendants were over 101,000 vbytes, any newly-received\ntransaction that was also a descendant would be ignored.  Now, one\nextra descendant will be allowed provided it is an immediate\ndescendant (child) and the child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s size is 10,000 vbytes or less.\nThis makes it possible for two-party contract protocols such as\nLightning Network to give each participant an output they can spend\nimmediately for Child-Pays-For-Parent (CPFP) fee bumping without\nallowing one malicious participant to fill the entire package and thus\nprevent the other participant from spending their output. (#15681)\n\n\nTransactions with outputs paying v1 to v16 witness versions (future\nsegwit versions) are now accepted into the mempool, relayed, and\nmined.  Attempting to spend those outputs remains forbidden by policy\n(\u00e2\u0080\u009cnon-standard\u00e2\u0080\u009d).  When this change has been widely deployed, wallets\nand services can accept any valid bech32 Bitcoin address without\nconcern that transactions paying future segwit versions will become\nstuck in an unconfirmed state. (#15846)\n\n\nLegacy transactions (transactions with no segwit inputs) must now be\nsent using the legacy encoding format, enforcing the rule specified in\nBIP144.  (#14039)\n\n\nWallet\n\n\nWhen in pruned mode, a rescan that was triggered by an importwallet,\nimportpubkey, importaddress, or importprivkey RPC will only fail\nwhen blocks have been pruned. Previously it would fail when -prune\nhas been set.  This change allows setting -prune to a high value\n(e.g. the disk size) without the calls to any of the import RPCs\nfailing until the first block is pruned. (#15870)\n\n\nWhen creating a transaction with a fee above -maxtxfee (default 0.1\nBTC), the RPC commands walletcreatefundedpsbt and\nfundrawtransaction will now fail instead of rounding down the fee.\nBe aware that the feeRate argument is specified in BTC per 1,000\nvbytes, not satoshi per vbyte. (#16257)\n\n\nA new wallet flag avoid_reuse has been added (default off). When\nenabled, a wallet will distinguish between used and unused addresses,\nand default to not use the former in coin selection.  When setting\nthis flag on an existing wallet, rescanning the blockchain is required\nto correctly mark previously used destinations.  Together with \u00e2\u0080\u009cavoid\npartial spends\u00e2\u0080\u009d (added in Bitcoin Core v0.17.0), this can eliminate a\nserious privacy issue where a malicious user can track spends by\nsending small payments to a previously-paid address that would then\nbe included with unrelated inputs in future payments. (#13756)\n\n\nBuild system changes\n\n\nPython >=3.5 is now required by all aspects of the project. This\nincludes the build systems, test framework and linters. The previously\nsupported minimum (3.4), was EOL in March 2019. (#14954)\n\n\nThe minimum supported miniUPnPc API version is set to 10. This keeps\ncompatibility with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Debian 8 libminiupnpc-dev\npackages. Please note, on Debian this package is still vulnerable to\nCVE-2017-8798\n(in jessie only) and\nCVE-2017-1000494\n(both in jessie and in stretch).

Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt</code> (on Mac)\nor <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoind</code>/<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin-qt</code> (on Linux).</p>\n<p>Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\npossible, but might take some time if the datadir needs to be migrated.  Old\nwallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.</p>\n<h1 id=\"compatibility\">Compatibility</h1>\n<p>Bitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems using\nthe Linux kernel, macOS 10.10+, and Windows 7 and newer. It is not recommended\nto use Bitcoin Core on unsupported systems.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not\nas frequently tested on them.</p>\n<p>From 0.17.0 onwards, macOS &lt;10.10 is no longer supported. 0.17.0 is\nbuilt using Qt 5.9.x, which doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t support versions of macOS older than\n10.10. Additionally, Bitcoin Core does not yet change appearance when\nmacOS \u00e2\u0080\u009cdark mode\u00e2\u0080\u009d is activated.</p>\n<p>Users running macOS Catalina may need to \u00e2\u0080\u009cright-click\u00e2\u0080\u009d and then choose \u00e2\u0080\u009cOpen\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nto open the Bitcoin Core .dmg. This is due to new signing requirements\nimposed by Apple, which the Bitcoin Core project does not yet adhere too.</p>\n<h1 id=\"notable-changes\">Notable changes</h1>\n<h2 id=\"new-user-documentation\">New user documentation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/reduce-memory.md\">Reduce memory</a>\nsuggests configuration tweaks for running Bitcoin Core on systems with\nlimited memory. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16339\">#16339</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"new-rpcs\">New RPCs</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getbalances</code> returns an object with all balances (<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">mine</code>,\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">untrusted_pending</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">immature</code>). Please refer to the RPC help of\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getbalances</code> for details. The new RPC is intended to replace\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getbalance</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getunconfirmedbalance</code>, and the balance fields in\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getwalletinfo</code>.  These old calls and fields may be removed in a\nfuture version. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15930\">#15930</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16239\">#16239</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">setwalletflag</code> sets and unsets wallet flags that enable or disable\nfeatures specific to that existing wallet, such as the new\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">avoid_reuse</code> feature documented elsewhere in these release notes.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13756\">#13756</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getblockfilter</code> gets the BIP158 filter for the specified block.  This\nRPC is only enabled if block filters have been created using the\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-blockfilterindex</code> configuration option. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14121\">#14121</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"new-settings\">New settings</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-blockfilterindex</code> enables the creation of BIP158 block filters for\nthe entire blockchain.  Filters will be created in the background and\ncurrently use about 4 GiB of space.  Note: this version of Bitcoin\nCore does not serve block filters over the P2P network, although the\nlocal user may obtain block filters using the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getblockfilter</code> RPC.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14121\">#14121</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"updated-settings\">Updated settings</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">whitebind</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">whitelist</code> now accept a list of permissions to\nprovide peers connecting using the indicated interfaces or IP\naddresses.  If no permissions are specified with an address or CIDR\nnetwork, the implicit default permissions are the same as previous\nreleases.  See the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoind -help</code> output for these two options for\ndetails about the available permissions. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16248\">#16248</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Users setting custom <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">dbcache</code> values can increase their setting slightly\nwithout using any more real memory.  Recent changes reduced the memory use\nby about 9% and made chainstate accounting more accurate (it was underestimating\nthe use of memory before).  For example, if you set a value of \u00e2\u0080\u009c450\u00e2\u0080\u009d before, you\nmay now set a value of \u00e2\u0080\u009c500\u00e2\u0080\u009d to use about the same real amount of memory. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16957\">#16957</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"updated-rpcs\">Updated RPCs</h2>\n<p>Note: some low-level RPC changes mainly useful for testing are described in the\nLow-level Changes section below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">sendmany</code> no longer has a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">minconf</code> argument.

In this release, the download logic has\nchanged to randomize the fetch order across peers and to prefer sending\ndownload requests to outbound peers over inbound peers.

Previously,\nif a transaction in the mempool had 25 descendants, or it and all of\nits descendants were over 101,000 vbytes, any newly-received\ntransaction that was also a descendant would be ignored.  Now, one\nextra descendant will be allowed provided it is an immediate\ndescendant (child) and the child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s size is 10,000 vbytes or less.\nThis makes it possible for two-party contract protocols such as\nLightning Network to give each participant an output they can spend\nimmediately for Child-Pays-For-Parent (CPFP) fee bumping without\nallowing one malicious participant to fill the entire package and thus\nprevent the other participant from spending their output. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15681\">#15681</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Transactions with outputs paying v1 to v16 witness versions (future\nsegwit versions) are now accepted into the mempool, relayed, and\nmined.  Attempting to spend those outputs remains forbidden by policy\n(\u00e2\u0080\u009cnon-standard\u00e2\u0080\u009d).

Together with \u00e2\u0080\u009cavoid\npartial spends\u00e2\u0080\u009d (added in Bitcoin Core v0.17.0), this can eliminate a\nserious privacy issue where a malicious user can track spends by\nsending small payments to a previously-paid address that would then\nbe included with unrelated inputs in future payments.

Wait until it has\ncompletely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older\nversions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over\n/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on\nLinux).\nThe first time you run version 0.15.0 or newer, your chainstate database\nwill be converted to a new format, which will take anywhere from a few\nminutes to half an hour, depending on the speed of your machine.\nNote that the block database format also changed in version 0.8.0 and\nthere is no automatic upgrade code from before version 0.8 to version\n0.15.0 or later. Upgrading directly from 0.7.x and earlier without\nredownloading the blockchain is not supported.  However, as usual, old\nwallet versions are still supported.\nCompatibility\nBitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\nusing the Linux kernel, macOS 10.10+, and Windows 7 and newer. It is not\nrecommended to use Bitcoin Core on unsupported systems.\nBitcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not\nas frequently tested on them.\nFrom 0.17.0 onwards, macOS <10.10 is no longer supported. 0.17.0 is\nbuilt using Qt 5.9.x, which doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t support versions of macOS older than\n10.10. Additionally, Bitcoin Core does not yet change appearance when\nmacOS \u00e2\u0080\u009cdark mode\u00e2\u0080\u009d is activated.\nKnown issues\nWallet GUI\nFor advanced users who have both (1) enabled coin control features, and\n(2) are using multiple wallets loaded at the same time: The coin control\ninput selection dialog can erroneously retain wrong-wallet state when\nswitching wallets using the dropdown menu. For now, it is recommended\nnot to use coin control features with multiple wallets loaded.\n0.18.1 change log\nP2P protocol and network code\n\n#15990 Add tests and documentation for blocksonly (MarcoFalke)\n#16021 Avoid logging transaction decode errors to stderr (MarcoFalke)\n#16405 fix: tor: Call event_base_loopbreak from the event\u00e2\u0080\u0099s callback (promag)\n#16412 Make poll in InterruptibleRecv only filter for POLLIN events (tecnovert)\n\nWallet\n\n#15913 Add -ignorepartialspends to list of ignored wallet options (luke-jr)\n\nRPC and other APIs\n\n#15991 Bugfix: fix pruneblockchain returned prune height (jonasschnelli)\n#15899 Document iswitness flag and fix bug in converttopsbt (MarcoFalke)\n#16026 Ensure that uncompressed public keys in a multisig always returns a legacy address (achow101)\n#14039 Disallow extended encoding for non-witness transactions (sipa)\n#16210 add 2nd arg to signrawtransactionwithkey examples (dooglus)\n#16250 signrawtransactionwithkey: report error when missing redeemScript/witnessScript (ajtowns)\n\nGUI\n\n#16044 fix the bug of OPEN CONFIGURATION FILE on Mac (shannon1916)\n#15957 Show \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo wallets available\u00e2\u0080\u009d in open menu instead of nothing (meshcollider)\n#16118 Enable open wallet menu on setWalletController (promag)\n#16135 Set progressDialog to nullptr (promag)\n#16231 Fix open wallet menu initialization order (promag)\n#16254 Set AA_EnableHighDpiScaling attribute early (hebasto)\n#16122 Enable console line edit on setClientModel (promag)\n#16348 Assert QMetaObject::invokeMethod result (promag)\n\nBuild system\n\n#15985 Add test for GCC bug 90348 (sipa)\n#15947 Install bitcoin-wallet manpage (domob1812)\n#15983 build with -fstack-reuse=none (MarcoFalke)\n\nTests and QA\n\n#15826 Pure python EC (sipa)\n#15893 Add test for superfluous witness record in deserialization (instagibbs)\n#14818 Bugfix: test/functional/rpc_psbt: Remove check for specific error message that depends on uncertain assumptions (luke-jr)\n#15831 Add test that addmultisigaddress fails for watchonly addresses (MarcoFalke)\n\nDocumentation\n\n#15890 Remove text about txes always relayed from -whitelist (harding)\n\nMiscellaneous\n\n#16095 Catch by reference not value in wallettool (kristapsk)\n#16205 Replace fprintf with tfm::format (MarcoFalke)\n\nCredits\nThanks to everyone who directly contributed to this release:\n\nAndrew Chow\nAnthony Towns\nChris Moore\nDaniel Kraft\nDavid A.

Wait until it has\ncompletely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older\nversions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over\n/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on\nLinux).\nThe first time you run version 0.15.0 or newer, your chainstate database\nwill be converted to a new format, which will take anywhere from a few\nminutes to half an hour, depending on the speed of your machine.\nNote that the block database format also changed in version 0.8.0 and\nthere is no automatic upgrade code from before version 0.8 to version\n0.15.0 or later. Upgrading directly from 0.7.x and earlier without\nredownloading the blockchain is not supported.  However, as usual, old\nwallet versions are still supported.\nCompatibility\nBitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\nusing the Linux kernel, macOS 10.10+, and Windows 7 and newer. It is not\nrecommended to use Bitcoin Core on unsupported systems.\nBitcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not\nas frequently tested on them.\nFrom 0.17.0 onwards, macOS <10.10 is no longer supported. 0.17.0 is\nbuilt using Qt 5.9.x, which doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t support versions of macOS older than\n10.10. Additionally, Bitcoin Core does not yet change appearance when\nmacOS \u00e2\u0080\u009cdark mode\u00e2\u0080\u009d is activated.\nIn addition to previously-supported CPU platforms, this release\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\npre-compiled distribution also provides binaries for the RISC-V\nplatform.\nIf you are using the systemd unit configuration file located at\ncontrib/init/bitcoind.service, it has been changed to use\n/var/lib/bitcoind as the data directory instead of\n~bitcoin/.bitcoin. When switching over to the new configuration file,\nplease make sure that the filesystem on which /var/lib/bitcoind will\nexist has enough space (check using df -h /var/lib/bitcoind), and\noptionally copy over your existing data directory. See the systemd init\nfile section for more details.\nKnown issues\nWallet GUI\nFor advanced users who have both (1) enabled coin control features, and\n(2) are using multiple wallets loaded at the same time: The coin control\ninput selection dialog can erroneously retain wrong-wallet state when\nswitching wallets using the dropdown menu. For now, it is recommended\nnot to use coin control features with multiple wallets loaded.\nNotable changes\nMining\n\nCalls to getblocktemplate will fail if the segwit rule is not\nspecified.  Calling getblocktemplate without segwit specified is\nalmost certainly a misconfiguration since doing so results in lower\nrewards for the miner.  Failed calls will produce an error message\ndescribing how to enable the segwit rule.\n\nConfiguration option changes\n\n\nA warning is printed if an unrecognized section name is used in the\nconfiguration file.  Recognized sections are [test], [main], and\n[regtest].\n\n\nFour new options are available for configuring the maximum number of\nmessages that ZMQ will queue in memory (the \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh water mark\u00e2\u0080\u009d) before\ndropping additional messages.  The default value is 1,000, the same as\nwas used for previous releases.  See the ZMQ\ndocumentation\nfor details.\n\n\nThe rpcallowip option can no longer be used to automatically listen\non all network interfaces.  Instead, the rpcbind parameter must be\nused to specify the IP addresses to listen on.  Listening for RPC\ncommands over a public network connection is insecure and should be\ndisabled, so a warning is now printed if a user selects such a\nconfiguration.  If you need to expose RPC in order to use a tool like\nDocker, ensure you only bind RPC to your localhost, e.g. docker run\n[...] -p 127.0.0.1:8332:8332 (this is an extra :8332 over the\nnormal Docker port specification).\n\n\nThe rpcpassword option now causes a startup error if the password\nset in the configuration file contains a hash character (#), as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nambiguous whether the hash character is meant for the password or as a\ncomment.\n\n\nThe whitelistforcerelay option is used to relay transactions from\nwhitelisted peers even when not accepted to the mempool. This option\nnow defaults to being off, so that changes in policy and\ndisconnect/ban behavior will not cause a node that is whitelisting\nanother to be dropped by peers.  Users can still explicitly enable\nthis behavior with the command line option (and may want to consider\ncontacting the Bitcoin Core\nproject to let us know about their use-case, as this feature could be\ndeprecated in the future).\n\n\nsystemd init file\nThe systemd init file (contrib/init/bitcoind.service) has been changed\nto use /var/lib/bitcoind as the data directory instead of\n~bitcoin/.bitcoin. This change makes Bitcoin Core more consistent with\nother services, and makes the systemd init config more consistent with\nexisting Upstart and OpenRC configs.\nThe configuration, PID, and data directories are now completely managed\nby systemd, which will take care of their creation, permissions, etc.\nSee systemd.exec(5)\nfor more details.\nWhen using the provided init files under contrib/init, overriding the\ndatadir option in /etc/bitcoin/bitcoin.conf will have no effect.\nThis is because the command line arguments specified in the init files\ntake precedence over the options specified in\n/etc/bitcoin/bitcoin.conf.\nDocumentation\n\n\nA new short document\nabout the JSON-RPC interface describes cases where the results of an\nRPC might contain inconsistencies between data sourced from different\nsubsystems, such as wallet state and mempool state.  A note is added\nto the REST interface documentation\nindicating that the same rules apply.\n\n\nFurther information is added to the JSON-RPC\ndocumentation\nabout how to secure this interface.\n\n\nA new document\nabout the bitcoin.conf file describes how to use it to configure\nBitcoin Core.\n\n\nA new document introduces Bitcoin Core\u00e2\u0080\u0099s BIP174 Partially-Signed\nBitcoin Transactions\n(PSBT)\ninterface, which is used to allow multiple programs to collaboratively\nwork to create, sign, and broadcast new transactions.  This is useful\nfor offline (cold storage) wallets, multisig wallets, coinjoin\nimplementations, and many other cases where two or more programs need\nto interact to generate a complete transaction.\n\n\nThe output script\ndescriptor\ndocumentation has been updated with information about new features in\nthis still-developing language for describing the output scripts that\na wallet or other program wants to receive notifications for, such as\nwhich addresses it wants to know received payments.  The language is\ncurrently used in multiple new and updated RPCs described in these\nrelease notes and is expected to be adapted to other RPCs and to the\nunderlying wallet structure.\n\n\nBuild system changes\n\n\nA new --disable-bip70 option may be passed to ./configure to\nprevent Bitcoin-Qt from being built with support for the BIP70 payment\nprotocol or from linking libssl.  As the payment protocol has exposed\nBitcoin Core to libssl vulnerabilities in the past, builders who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nneed BIP70 support are encouraged to use this option to reduce their\nexposure to future vulnerabilities.\n\n\nThe minimum required version of Qt (when building the GUI) has been\nincreased from 5.2 to 5.5.1 (the depends\nsystem\nprovides 5.9.7)\n\n\nNew RPCs\n\n\ngetnodeaddresses returns peer addresses known to this node. It may\nbe used to find nodes to connect to without using a DNS seeder.\n\n\nlistwalletdir returns a list of wallets in the wallet directory\n(either the default wallet directory or the directory configured by\nthe -walletdir parameter).\n\n\ngetrpcinfo returns runtime details of the RPC server. At the moment,\nit returns an array of the currently active commands and how long\nthey\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been running.\n\n\nderiveaddresses returns one or more addresses corresponding to an\noutput descriptor.\n\n\ngetdescriptorinfo accepts a descriptor and returns information about\nit, including its computed checksum.\n\n\njoinpsbts merges multiple distinct PSBTs into a single PSBT. The\nmultiple PSBTs must have different inputs. The resulting PSBT will\ncontain every input and output from all of the PSBTs. Any signatures\nprovided in any of the PSBTs will be dropped.\n\n\nanalyzepsbt examines a PSBT and provides information about what\nthe PSBT contains and the next steps that need to be taken in order\nto complete the transaction. For each input of a PSBT, analyzepsbt\nprovides information about what information is missing for that\ninput, including whether a UTXO needs to be provided, what pubkeys\nstill need to be provided, which scripts need to be provided, and\nwhat signatures are still needed. Every input will also list which\nrole is needed to complete that input, and analyzepsbt will also\nlist the next role in general needed to complete the PSBT.\nanalyzepsbt will also provide the estimated fee rate and estimated\nvirtual size of the completed transaction if it has enough\ninformation to do so.\n\n\nutxoupdatepsbt searches the set of Unspent Transaction Outputs\n(UTXOs) to find the outputs being spent by the partial transaction.\nPSBTs need to have the UTXOs being spent to be provided because\nthe signing algorithm requires information from the UTXO being spent.\nFor segwit inputs, only the UTXO itself is necessary.  For\nnon-segwit outputs, the entire previous transaction is needed so\nthat signers can be sure that they are signing the correct thing.\nUnfortunately, because the UTXO set only contains UTXOs and not full\ntransactions, utxoupdatepsbt will only add the UTXO for segwit\ninputs.\n\n\nUpdated RPCs\nNote: some low-level RPC changes mainly useful for testing are described\nin the Low-level Changes section below.\n\n\ngetpeerinfo now returns an additional minfeefilter field set to\nthe peer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s BIP133 fee filter.  You can use this to detect that you\nhave peers that are willing to accept transactions below the default\nminimum relay fee.\n\n\nThe mempool RPCs, such as getrawmempool with verbose=true, now\nreturn an additional \u00e2\u0080\u009cbip125-replaceable\u00e2\u0080\u009d value indicating whether the\ntransaction (or its unconfirmed ancestors) opts-in to asking nodes and\nminers to replace it with a higher-feerate transaction spending any of\nthe same inputs.\n\n\nsettxfee previously silently ignored attempts to set the fee below\nthe allowed minimums.  It now prints a warning.  The special value of\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c0\u00e2\u0080\u009d may still be used to request the minimum value.\n\n\ngetaddressinfo now provides an ischange field indicating whether\nthe wallet used the address in a change output.\n\n\nimportmulti has been updated to support P2WSH, P2WPKH, P2SH-P2WPKH,\nand P2SH-P2WSH. Requests for P2WSH and P2SH-P2WSH accept an additional\nwitnessscript parameter.\n\n\nimportmulti now returns an additional warnings field for each\nrequest with an array of strings explaining when fields are being\nignored or are inconsistent, if there are any.\n\n\ngetaddressinfo now returns an additional solvable boolean field\nwhen Bitcoin Core knows enough about the address\u00e2\u0080\u0099s scriptPubKey,\noptional redeemScript, and optional witnessScript in order for the\nwallet to be able to generate an unsigned input spending funds sent to\nthat address.\n\n\nThe getaddressinfo, listunspent, and scantxoutset RPCs now\nreturn an additional desc field that contains an output descriptor\ncontaining all key paths and signing information for the address\n(except for the private key).  The desc field is only returned for\ngetaddressinfo and listunspent when the address is solvable.\n\n\nimportprivkey will preserve previously-set labels for addresses or\npublic keys corresponding to the private key being imported.  For\nexample, if you imported a watch-only address with the label \u00e2\u0080\u009ccold\nwallet\u00e2\u0080\u009d in earlier releases of Bitcoin Core, subsequently importing\nthe private key would default to resetting the address\u00e2\u0080\u0099s label to the\ndefault empty-string label (\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u009d).  In this release, the previous label\nof \u00e2\u0080\u009ccold wallet\u00e2\u0080\u009d will be retained.  If you optionally specify any\nlabel besides the default when calling importprivkey, the new label\nwill be applied to the address.\n\n\nSee the Mining section for changes to getblocktemplate.\n\n\ngetmininginfo now omits currentblockweight and currentblocktx\nwhen a block was never assembled via RPC on this node.\n\n\nThe getrawtransaction RPC & REST endpoints no longer check the\nunspent UTXO set for a transaction. The remaining behaviors are as\nfollows: 1. If a blockhash is provided, check the corresponding block.  2.\nIf no blockhash is provided, check the mempool. 3. If no blockhash\nis provided but txindex is enabled, also check txindex.\n\n\nunloadwallet is now synchronous, meaning it will not return until\nthe wallet is fully unloaded.\n\n\nimportmulti now supports importing of addresses from descriptors. A\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cdesc\u00e2\u0080\u009d parameter can be provided instead of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cscriptPubKey\u00e2\u0080\u009d in a\nrequest, as well as an optional range for ranged descriptors to\nspecify the start and end of the range to import. Descriptors with key\norigin information imported through importmulti will have their key\norigin information stored in the wallet for use with creating PSBTs.\nMore information about descriptors can be found\nhere.\n\n\nlistunspent has been modified so that it also returns\nwitnessScript, the witness script in the case of a P2WSH or\nP2SH-P2WSH output.\n\n\ncreatewallet now has an optional blank argument that can be used\nto create a blank wallet. Blank wallets do not have any keys or HD\nseed.  They cannot be opened in software older than 0.18. Once a blank\nwallet has a HD seed set (by using sethdseed) or private keys,\nscripts, addresses, and other watch only things have been imported,\nthe wallet is no longer blank and can be opened in 0.17.x. Encrypting\na blank wallet will also set a HD seed for it.\n\n\nDeprecated or removed RPCs\n\n\nsignrawtransaction is removed after being deprecated and hidden\nbehind a special configuration option in version 0.17.0.\n\n\nThe \u00e2\u0080\u0098account\u00e2\u0080\u0099 API is removed after being deprecated in v0.17.  The\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098label\u00e2\u0080\u0099 API was introduced in v0.17 as a replacement for accounts.\nSee the release notes from\nv0.17\nfor a full description of the changes from the \u00e2\u0080\u0098account\u00e2\u0080\u0099 API to the\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098label\u00e2\u0080\u0099 API.\n\n\naddwitnessaddress is removed after being deprecated in version\n0.16.0.\n\n\ngenerate is deprecated and will be fully removed in a subsequent\nmajor version.  This RPC is only used for testing, but its\nimplementation reached across multiple subsystems (wallet and mining),\nso it is being deprecated to simplify the wallet-node interface.\nProjects that are using generate for testing purposes should\ntransition to using the generatetoaddress RPC, which does not\nrequire or use the wallet component. Calling generatetoaddress with\nan address returned by the getnewaddress RPC gives the same\nfunctionality as the old generate RPC.  To continue using generate\nin this version, restart bitcoind with the -deprecatedrpc=generate\nconfiguration option.\n\n\nBe reminded that parts of the validateaddress command have been\ndeprecated and moved to getaddressinfo. The following deprecated\nfields have moved to getaddressinfo: ismine, iswatchonly,\nscript, hex, pubkeys, sigsrequired, pubkey, embedded,\niscompressed, label, timestamp, hdkeypath, hdmasterkeyid.\n\n\nThe addresses field has been removed from the validateaddress\nand getaddressinfo RPC methods.  This field was confusing since\nit referred to public keys using their P2PKH address.  Clients\nshould use the embedded.address field for P2SH or P2WSH wrapped\naddresses, and pubkeys for inspecting multisig participants.\n\n\nREST changes\n\nA new /rest/blockhashbyheight/ endpoint is added for fetching the\nhash of the block in the current best blockchain based on its height\n(how many blocks it is after the Genesis Block).\n\nGraphical User Interface (GUI)\n\n\nA new Window menu is added alongside the existing File, Settings, and\nHelp menus.  Several items from the other menus that opened new\nwindows have been moved to this new Window menu.\n\n\nIn the Send tab, the checkbox for \u00e2\u0080\u009cpay only the required fee\u00e2\u0080\u009d has been\nremoved.  Instead, the user can simply decrease the value in the\nCustom Feerate field all the way down to the node\u00e2\u0080\u0099s configured minimum\nrelay fee.\n\n\nIn the Overview tab, the watch-only balance will be the only balance\nshown if the wallet was created using the createwallet RPC and the\ndisable_private_keys parameter was set to true.\n\n\nThe launch-on-startup option is no longer available on macOS if\ncompiled with macosx min version greater than 10.11 (use\nCXXFLAGS=\u00e2\u0080\u009d-mmacosx-version-min=10.11\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nCFLAGS=\u00e2\u0080\u009d-mmacosx-version-min=10.11\u00e2\u0080\u009d for setting the deployment sdk\nversion)\n\n\nTools\n\nA new bitcoin-wallet tool is now distributed alongside Bitcoin\nCore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other executables.  Without needing to use any RPCs, this tool\ncan currently create a new wallet file or display some basic\ninformation about an existing wallet, such as whether the wallet is\nencrypted, whether it uses an HD seed, how many transactions it\ncontains, and how many address book entries it has.\n\nPlanned changes\nThis section describes planned changes to Bitcoin Core that may affect\nother Bitcoin software and services.\n\nSince version 0.16.0, Bitcoin Core\u00e2\u0080\u0099s built-in wallet has defaulted to\ngenerating P2SH-wrapped segwit addresses when users want to receive\npayments. These addresses are backwards compatible with all\nwidely-used software.  Starting with Bitcoin Core 0.20 (expected about\na year after 0.18), Bitcoin Core will default to native segwit\naddresses (bech32) that provide additional fee savings and other\nbenefits. Currently, many wallets and services already support sending\nto bech32 addresses, and if the Bitcoin Core project sees enough\nadditional adoption, it will instead default to bech32 receiving\naddresses in Bitcoin Core 0.19 (approximately November 2019).\nP2SH-wrapped segwit addresses will continue to be provided if the user\nrequests them in the GUI or by RPC, and anyone who doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want the\nupdate will be able to configure their default address type.\n(Similarly, pioneering users who want to change their default now may\nset the addresstype=bech32 configuration option in any Bitcoin Core\nrelease from 0.16.0 up.)\n\nDeprecated P2P messages\n\nBIP 61 reject messages are now deprecated. Reject messages have no use\ncase on the P2P network and are only logged for debugging by most\nnetwork nodes. Furthermore, they increase bandwidth and can be harmful\nfor privacy and security. It has been possible to disable BIP 61\nmessages since v0.17 with the -enablebip61=0 option. BIP 61 messages\nwill be disabled by default in a future version, before being removed\nentirely.\n\nLow-level changes\nThis section describes RPC changes mainly useful for testing, mostly not\nrelevant in production. The changes are mentioned for completeness.\nRPC\n\n\nThe submitblock RPC previously returned the reason a rejected block\nwas invalid the first time it processed that block, but returned a\ngeneric \u00e2\u0080\u009cduplicate\u00e2\u0080\u009d rejection message on subsequent occasions it\nprocessed the same block.  It now always returns the fundamental\nreason for rejecting an invalid block and only returns \u00e2\u0080\u009cduplicate\u00e2\u0080\u009d for\nvalid blocks it has already accepted.\n\n\nA new submitheader RPC allows submitting block headers independently\nfrom their block.  This is likely only useful for testing.\n\n\nThe signrawtransactionwithkey and signrawtransactionwithwallet\nRPCs have been modified so that they also optionally accept a\nwitnessScript, the witness script in the case of a P2WSH or\nP2SH-P2WSH output. This is compatible with the change to\nlistunspent.\n\n\nFor the walletprocesspsbt and walletcreatefundedpsbt RPCs, if the\nbip32derivs parameter is set to true but the key metadata for a\npublic key has not been updated yet, then that key will have a\nderivation path as if it were just an independent key (i.e. no\nderivation path and its master fingerprint is itself).\n\n\nConfiguration\n\nThe -usehd configuration option was removed in version 0.16. From\nthat version onwards, all new wallets created are hierarchical\ndeterministic wallets. This release makes specifying -usehd an\ninvalid configuration option.\n\nNetwork\n\nThis release allows peers that your node automatically disconnected\nfor misbehavior (e.g. sending invalid data) to reconnect to your node\nif you have unused incoming connection slots.  If your slots fill up,\na misbehaving node will be disconnected to make room for nodes without\na history of problems (unless the misbehaving node helps your node in\nsome other way, such as by connecting to a part of the Internet from\nwhich you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have many other peers).  Previously, Bitcoin Core\nbanned the IP addresses of misbehaving peers for a period of time\n(default of 1 day); this was easily circumvented by attackers with\nmultiple IP addresses. If you manually ban a peer, such as by using\nthe setban RPC, all connections from that peer will still be\nrejected.\n\nWallet\n\n\nThe key metadata will need to be upgraded the first time that the HD\nseed is available.  For unencrypted wallets this will occur on wallet\nloading.  For encrypted wallets this will occur the first time the\nwallet is unlocked.\n\n\nNewly encrypted wallets will no longer require restarting the\nsoftware. Instead such wallets will be completely unloaded and\nreloaded to achieve the same effect.\n\n\nA sub-project of Bitcoin Core now provides Hardware Wallet Interaction\n(HWI) scripts that allow command-line users to use several popular\nhardware key management devices with Bitcoin Core.  See their project\npage for details.\n\n\nSecurity\n\nThis release changes the Random Number Generator (RNG) used from\nOpenSSL to Bitcoin Core\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own implementation, although entropy\ngathered by Bitcoin Core is fed out to OpenSSL and then read back in\nwhen the program needs strong randomness. This moves Bitcoin Core a\nlittle closer to no longer needing to depend on OpenSSL, a dependency\nthat has caused security issues in the past.  The new implementation\ngathers entropy from multiple sources, including from hardware\nsupporting the rdseed CPU instruction.\n\nChanges for particular platforms\n\nOn macOS, Bitcoin Core now opts out of application CPU throttling\n(\u00e2\u0080\u009capp nap\u00e2\u0080\u009d) during initial blockchain download, when catching up from\nover 100 blocks behind the current chain tip, or when reindexing chain\ndata. This helps prevent these operations from taking an excessively\nlong time because the operating system is attempting to conserve\npower.\n\n0.18.0 change log\nConsensus\n\n#14247 Fix crash bug with duplicate inputs within a transaction (TheBlueMatt)\n\nMining\n\n#14811 Mining: Enforce that segwit option must be set in GBT (jnewbery)\n\nBlock and transaction handling\n\n#13310 Report progress in ReplayBlocks while rolling forward (promag)\n#13783 validation: Pass tx pool reference into CheckSequenceLocks (MarcoFalke)\n#14834 validation: Assert that pindexPrev is non-null when required (kallewoof)\n#14085 index: Fix for indexers skipping genesis block (jimpo)\n#14963 mempool, validation: Explain cs_main locking semantics (MarcoFalke)\n#15193 Default -whitelistforcerelay to off (sdaftuar)\n#15429 Update assumevalid, minimumchainwork, and getchaintxstats to height 563378 (gmaxwell)\n#15552 Granular invalidateblock and RewindBlockIndex (MarcoFalke)\n#14841 Move CheckBlock() call to critical section (hebasto)\n\nP2P protocol and network code\n\n#14025 Remove dead code for nVersion=10300 (MarcoFalke)\n#12254 BIP 158: Compact Block Filters for Light Clients (jimpo)\n#14073 blockfilter: Avoid out-of-bounds script access (jimpo)\n#14140 Switch nPrevNodeCount to vNodesSize (pstratem)\n#14027 Skip stale tip checking if outbound connections are off or if reindexing (gmaxwell)\n#14532 Never bind INADDR_ANY by default, and warn when doing so explicitly (luke-jr)\n#14733 Make peer timeout configurable, speed up very slow test and ensure correct code path tested (zallarak)\n#14336 Implement poll (pstratem)\n#15051 IsReachable is the inverse of IsLimited (DRY).

Wait until it has\ncompletely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older\nversions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt</code> (on Mac) or <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoind</code>/<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin-qt</code> (on\nLinux).</p>\n<p>The first time you run version 0.15.0 or newer, your chainstate database\nwill be converted to a new format, which will take anywhere from a few\nminutes to half an hour, depending on the speed of your machine.</p>\n<p>Note that the block database format also changed in version 0.8.0 and\nthere is no automatic upgrade code from before version 0.8 to version\n0.15.0 or later. Upgrading directly from 0.7.x and earlier without\nredownloading the blockchain is not supported.  However, as usual, old\nwallet versions are still supported.</p>\n<h1 id=\"compatibility\">Compatibility</h1>\n<p>Bitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\nusing the Linux kernel, macOS 10.10+, and Windows 7 and newer. It is not\nrecommended to use Bitcoin Core on unsupported systems.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not\nas frequently tested on them.</p>\n<p>From 0.17.0 onwards, macOS &lt;10.10 is no longer supported. 0.17.0 is\nbuilt using Qt 5.9.x, which doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t support versions of macOS older than\n10.10. Additionally, Bitcoin Core does not yet change appearance when\nmacOS \u00e2\u0080\u009cdark mode\u00e2\u0080\u009d is activated.</p>\n<p>In addition to previously-supported CPU platforms, this release\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\npre-compiled distribution also provides binaries for the RISC-V\nplatform.</p>\n<p>If you are using the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">systemd</code> unit configuration file located at\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">contrib/init/bitcoind.service</code>, it has been changed to use\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">/var/lib/bitcoind</code> as the data directory instead of\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">~bitcoin/.bitcoin</code>. When switching over to the new configuration file,\nplease make sure that the filesystem on which <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">/var/lib/bitcoind</code> will\nexist has enough space (check using <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">df -h /var/lib/bitcoind</code>), and\noptionally copy over your existing data directory. See the <a href=\"#systemd-init-file\">systemd init\nfile section</a> for more details.</p>\n<h1 id=\"known-issues\">Known issues</h1>\n<h2 id=\"wallet-gui\">Wallet GUI</h2>\n<p>For advanced users who have both (1) enabled coin control features, and\n(2) are using multiple wallets loaded at the same time: The coin control\ninput selection dialog can erroneously retain wrong-wallet state when\nswitching wallets using the dropdown menu. For now, it is recommended\nnot to use coin control features with multiple wallets loaded.</p>\n<h1 id=\"notable-changes\">Notable changes</h1>\n<h2 id=\"mining\">Mining</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Calls to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getblocktemplate</code> will fail if the segwit rule is not\nspecified.  Calling <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getblocktemplate</code> without segwit specified is\nalmost certainly a misconfiguration since doing so results in lower\nrewards for the miner.  Failed calls will produce an error message\ndescribing how to enable the segwit rule.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"configuration-option-changes\">Configuration option changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A warning is printed if an unrecognized section name is used in the\nconfiguration file.  Recognized sections are <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">[test]</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">[main]</code>, and\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">[regtest]</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Four new options are available for configuring the maximum number of\nmessages that ZMQ will queue in memory (the \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh water mark\u00e2\u0080\u009d) before\ndropping additional messages.  The default value is 1,000, the same as\nwas used for previous releases.  See the <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/zmq.md#usage\">ZMQ\ndocumentation</a>\nfor details.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">rpcallowip</code> option can no longer be used to automatically listen\non all network interfaces.  Instead, the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">rpcbind</code> parameter must be\nused to specify the IP addresses to listen on.  Listening for RPC\ncommands over a public network connection is insecure and should be\ndisabled, so a warning is now printed if a user selects such a\nconfiguration.  If you need to expose RPC in order to use a tool like\nDocker, ensure you only bind RPC to your localhost, e.g. <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">docker run\n[...] -p 127.0.0.1:8332:8332</code> (this is an extra <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">:8332</code> over the\nnormal Docker port specification).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">rpcpassword</code> option now causes a startup error if the password\nset in the configuration file contains a hash character (#), as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nambiguous whether the hash character is meant for the password or as a\ncomment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">whitelistforcerelay</code> option is used to relay transactions from\nwhitelisted peers even when not accepted to the mempool. This option\nnow defaults to being off, so that changes in policy and\ndisconnect/ban behavior will not cause a node that is whitelisting\nanother to be dropped by peers.  Users can still explicitly enable\nthis behavior with the command line option (and may want to consider\n<a href=\"https://bitcoincore.org/en/contact/\">contacting</a> the Bitcoin Core\nproject to let us know about their use-case, as this feature could be\ndeprecated in the future).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"systemd-init-file\">systemd init file</h2>\n<p>The systemd init file (<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">contrib/init/bitcoind.service</code>) has been changed\nto use <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">/var/lib/bitcoind</code> as the data directory instead of\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">~bitcoin/.bitcoin</code>. This change makes Bitcoin Core more consistent with\nother services, and makes the systemd init config more consistent with\nexisting Upstart and OpenRC configs.</p>\n<p>The configuration, PID, and data directories are now completely managed\nby systemd, which will take care of their creation, permissions, etc.\nSee <a href=\"https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.exec.html#RuntimeDirectory=\"><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">systemd.exec(5)</code></a>\nfor more details.</p>\n<p>When using the provided init files under <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">contrib/init</code>, overriding the\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">datadir</code> option in <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">/etc/bitcoin/bitcoin.conf</code> will have no effect.\nThis is because the command line arguments specified in the init files\ntake precedence over the options specified in\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">/etc/bitcoin/bitcoin.conf</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"documentation\">Documentation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A new short <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/JSON-RPC-interface.md\">document</a>\nabout the JSON-RPC interface describes cases where the results of an\nRPC might contain inconsistencies between data sourced from different\nsubsystems, such as wallet state and mempool state.  A note is added\nto the <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/REST-interface.md\">REST interface documentation</a>\nindicating that the same rules apply.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Further information is added to the <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/JSON-RPC-interface.md\">JSON-RPC\ndocumentation</a>\nabout how to secure this interface.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A new <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/bitcoin-conf.md\">document</a>\nabout the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin.conf</code> file describes how to use it to configure\nBitcoin Core.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A new document introduces Bitcoin Core\u00e2\u0080\u0099s BIP174 <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/psbt.md\">Partially-Signed\nBitcoin Transactions\n(PSBT)</a>\ninterface, which is used to allow multiple programs to collaboratively\nwork to create, sign, and broadcast new transactions.  This is useful\nfor offline (cold storage) wallets, multisig wallets, coinjoin\nimplementations, and many other cases where two or more programs need\nto interact to generate a complete transaction.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/descriptors.md\">output script\ndescriptor</a>\ndocumentation has been updated with information about new features in\nthis still-developing language for describing the output scripts that\na wallet or other program wants to receive notifications for, such as\nwhich addresses it wants to know received payments.  The language is\ncurrently used in multiple new and updated RPCs described in these\nrelease notes and is expected to be adapted to other RPCs and to the\nunderlying wallet structure.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"build-system-changes\">Build system changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A new <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">--disable-bip70</code> option may be passed to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">./configure</code> to\nprevent Bitcoin-Qt from being built with support for the BIP70 payment\nprotocol or from linking libssl.  As the payment protocol has exposed\nBitcoin Core to libssl vulnerabilities in the past, builders who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nneed BIP70 support are encouraged to use this option to reduce their\nexposure to future vulnerabilities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The minimum required version of Qt (when building the GUI) has been\nincreased from 5.2 to 5.5.1 (the <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/depends/README.md\">depends\nsystem</a>\nprovides 5.9.7)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"new-rpcs\">New RPCs</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getnodeaddresses</code> returns peer addresses known to this node. It may\nbe used to find nodes to connect to without using a DNS seeder.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">listwalletdir</code> returns a list of wallets in the wallet directory\n(either the default wallet directory or the directory configured by\nthe <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-walletdir</code> parameter).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getrpcinfo</code> returns runtime details of the RPC server.

The\nmultiple PSBTs must have different inputs. The resulting PSBT will\ncontain every input and output from all of the PSBTs. Any signatures\nprovided in any of the PSBTs will be dropped.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">analyzepsbt</code> examines a PSBT and provides information about what\nthe PSBT contains and the next steps that need to be taken in order\nto complete the transaction. For each input of a PSBT, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">analyzepsbt</code>\nprovides information about what information is missing for that\ninput, including whether a UTXO needs to be provided, what pubkeys\nstill need to be provided, which scripts need to be provided, and\nwhat signatures are still needed. Every input will also list which\nrole is needed to complete that input, and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">analyzepsbt</code> will also\nlist the next role in general needed to complete the PSBT.\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">analyzepsbt</code> will also provide the estimated fee rate and estimated\nvirtual size of the completed transaction if it has enough\ninformation to do so.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">utxoupdatepsbt</code> searches the set of Unspent Transaction Outputs\n(UTXOs) to find the outputs being spent by the partial transaction.\nPSBTs need to have the UTXOs being spent to be provided because\nthe signing algorithm requires information from the UTXO being spent.\nFor segwit inputs, only the UTXO itself is necessary.  For\nnon-segwit outputs, the entire previous transaction is needed so\nthat signers can be sure that they are signing the correct thing.\nUnfortunately, because the UTXO set only contains UTXOs and not full\ntransactions, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">utxoupdatepsbt</code> will only add the UTXO for segwit\ninputs.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"updated-rpcs\">Updated RPCs</h2>\n<p>Note: some low-level RPC changes mainly useful for testing are described\nin the Low-level Changes section below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getpeerinfo</code> now returns an additional <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">minfeefilter</code> field set to\nthe peer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s BIP133 fee filter.  You can use this to detect that you\nhave peers that are willing to accept transactions below the default\nminimum relay fee.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The mempool RPCs, such as <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getrawmempool</code> with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">verbose=true</code>, now\nreturn an additional \u00e2\u0080\u009cbip125-replaceable\u00e2\u0080\u009d value indicating whether the\ntransaction (or its unconfirmed ancestors) opts-in to asking nodes and\nminers to replace it with a higher-feerate transaction spending any of\nthe same inputs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">settxfee</code> previously silently ignored attempts to set the fee below\nthe allowed minimums.

The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">desc</code> field is only returned for\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getaddressinfo</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">listunspent</code> when the address is solvable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">importprivkey</code> will preserve previously-set labels for addresses or\npublic keys corresponding to the private key being imported.  For\nexample, if you imported a watch-only address with the label \u00e2\u0080\u009ccold\nwallet\u00e2\u0080\u009d in earlier releases of Bitcoin Core, subsequently importing\nthe private key would default to resetting the address\u00e2\u0080\u0099s label to the\ndefault empty-string label (\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u009d).  In this release, the previous label\nof \u00e2\u0080\u009ccold wallet\u00e2\u0080\u009d will be retained.  If you optionally specify any\nlabel besides the default when calling <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">importprivkey</code>, the new label\nwill be applied to the address.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>See the <a href=\"#mining\">Mining</a> section for changes to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getblocktemplate</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getmininginfo</code> now omits <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">currentblockweight</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">currentblocktx</code>\nwhen a block was never assembled via RPC on this node.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getrawtransaction</code> RPC &amp; REST endpoints no longer check the\nunspent UTXO set for a transaction. The remaining behaviors are as\nfollows: 1. If a blockhash is provided, check the corresponding block.  2.\nIf no blockhash is provided, check the mempool. 3. If no blockhash\nis provided but txindex is enabled, also check txindex.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">unloadwallet</code> is now synchronous, meaning it will not return until\nthe wallet is fully unloaded.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">importmulti</code> now supports importing of addresses from descriptors. A\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cdesc\u00e2\u0080\u009d parameter can be provided instead of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cscriptPubKey\u00e2\u0080\u009d in a\nrequest, as well as an optional range for ranged descriptors to\nspecify the start and end of the range to import. Descriptors with key\norigin information imported through <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">importmulti</code> will have their key\norigin information stored in the wallet for use with creating PSBTs.\nMore information about descriptors can be found\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/descriptors.md\">here</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">listunspent</code> has been modified so that it also returns\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">witnessScript</code>, the witness script in the case of a P2WSH or\nP2SH-P2WSH output.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">createwallet</code> now has an optional <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">blank</code> argument that can be used\nto create a blank wallet.

This RPC is only used for testing, but its\nimplementation reached across multiple subsystems (wallet and mining),\nso it is being deprecated to simplify the wallet-node interface.\nProjects that are using <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">generate</code> for testing purposes should\ntransition to using the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">generatetoaddress</code> RPC, which does not\nrequire or use the wallet component. Calling <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">generatetoaddress</code> with\nan address returned by the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getnewaddress</code> RPC gives the same\nfunctionality as the old <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">generate</code> RPC.

Without needing to use any RPCs, this tool\ncan currently create a new wallet file or display some basic\ninformation about an existing wallet, such as whether the wallet is\nencrypted, whether it uses an HD seed, how many transactions it\ncontains, and how many address book entries it has.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"planned-changes\">Planned changes</h1>\n<p>This section describes planned changes to Bitcoin Core that may affect\nother Bitcoin software and services.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Since version 0.16.0, Bitcoin Core\u00e2\u0080\u0099s built-in wallet has defaulted to\ngenerating P2SH-wrapped segwit addresses when users want to receive\npayments. These addresses are backwards compatible with all\nwidely-used software.  Starting with Bitcoin Core 0.20 (expected about\na year after 0.18), Bitcoin Core will default to native segwit\naddresses (bech32) that provide additional fee savings and other\nbenefits. Currently, many wallets and services already support sending\nto bech32 addresses, and if the Bitcoin Core project sees enough\nadditional adoption, it will instead default to bech32 receiving\naddresses in Bitcoin Core 0.19 (approximately November 2019).\nP2SH-wrapped segwit addresses will continue to be provided if the user\nrequests them in the GUI or by RPC, and anyone who doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want the\nupdate will be able to configure their default address type.\n(Similarly, pioneering users who want to change their default now may\nset the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">addresstype=bech32</code> configuration option in any Bitcoin Core\nrelease from 0.16.0 up.)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"deprecated-p2p-messages\">Deprecated P2P messages</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>BIP 61 reject messages are now deprecated. Reject messages have no use\ncase on the P2P network and are only logged for debugging by most\nnetwork nodes. Furthermore, they increase bandwidth and can be harmful\nfor privacy and security. It has been possible to disable BIP 61\nmessages since v0.17 with the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-enablebip61=0</code> option. BIP 61 messages\nwill be disabled by default in a future version, before being removed\nentirely.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"low-level-changes\">Low-level changes</h1>\n<p>This section describes RPC changes mainly useful for testing, mostly not\nrelevant in production. The changes are mentioned for completeness.</p>\n<h2 id=\"rpc\">RPC</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">submitblock</code> RPC previously returned the reason a rejected block\nwas invalid the first time it processed that block, but returned a\ngeneric \u00e2\u0080\u009cduplicate\u00e2\u0080\u009d rejection message on subsequent occasions it\nprocessed the same block.  It now always returns the fundamental\nreason for rejecting an invalid block and only returns \u00e2\u0080\u009cduplicate\u00e2\u0080\u009d for\nvalid blocks it has already accepted.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A new <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">submitheader</code> RPC allows submitting block headers independently\nfrom their block.  This is likely only useful for testing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">signrawtransactionwithkey</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">signrawtransactionwithwallet</code>\nRPCs have been modified so that they also optionally accept a\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">witnessScript</code>, the witness script in the case of a P2WSH or\nP2SH-P2WSH output. This is compatible with the change to\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">listunspent</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">walletprocesspsbt</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">walletcreatefundedpsbt</code> RPCs, if the\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bip32derivs</code> parameter is set to true but the key metadata for a\npublic key has not been updated yet, then that key will have a\nderivation path as if it were just an independent key (i.e. no\nderivation path and its master fingerprint is itself).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"configuration\">Configuration</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-usehd</code> configuration option was removed in version 0.16. From\nthat version onwards, all new wallets created are hierarchical\ndeterministic wallets. This release makes specifying <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-usehd</code> an\ninvalid configuration option.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"network\">Network</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>This release allows peers that your node automatically disconnected\nfor misbehavior (e.g. sending invalid data) to reconnect to your node\nif you have unused incoming connection slots.  If your slots fill up,\na misbehaving node will be disconnected to make room for nodes without\na history of problems (unless the misbehaving node helps your node in\nsome other way, such as by connecting to a part of the Internet from\nwhich you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have many other peers).  Previously, Bitcoin Core\nbanned the IP addresses of misbehaving peers for a period of time\n(default of 1 day); this was easily circumvented by attackers with\nmultiple IP addresses. If you manually ban a peer, such as by using\nthe <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">setban</code> RPC, all connections from that peer will still be\nrejected.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"wallet\">Wallet</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The key metadata will need to be upgraded the first time that the HD\nseed is available.  For unencrypted wallets this will occur on wallet\nloading.  For encrypted wallets this will occur the first time the\nwallet is unlocked.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Newly encrypted wallets will no longer require restarting the\nsoftware. Instead such wallets will be completely unloaded and\nreloaded to achieve the same effect.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A sub-project of Bitcoin Core now provides Hardware Wallet Interaction\n(HWI) scripts that allow command-line users to use several popular\nhardware key management devices with Bitcoin Core.  See their <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI#readme\">project\npage</a> for details.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"security\">Security</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>This release changes the Random Number Generator (RNG) used from\nOpenSSL to Bitcoin Core\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own implementation, although entropy\ngathered by Bitcoin Core is fed out to OpenSSL and then read back in\nwhen the program needs strong randomness. This moves Bitcoin Core a\nlittle closer to no longer needing to depend on OpenSSL, a dependency\nthat has caused security issues in the past.  The new implementation\ngathers entropy from multiple sources, including from hardware\nsupporting the rdseed CPU instruction.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"changes-for-particular-platforms\">Changes for particular platforms</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>On macOS, Bitcoin Core now opts out of application CPU throttling\n(\u00e2\u0080\u009capp nap\u00e2\u0080\u009d) during initial blockchain download, when catching up from\nover 100 blocks behind the current chain tip, or when reindexing chain\ndata. This helps prevent these operations from taking an excessively\nlong time because the operating system is attempting to conserve\npower.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"0180-change-log\">0.18.0 change log</h1>\n<h3 id=\"consensus\">Consensus</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14247\">#14247</a> Fix crash bug with duplicate inputs within a transaction (TheBlueMatt)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"mining-1\">Mining</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14811\">#14811</a> Mining: Enforce that segwit option must be set in GBT (jnewbery)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"block-and-transaction-handling\">Block and transaction handling</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13310\">#13310</a> Report progress in ReplayBlocks while rolling forward (promag)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13783\">#13783</a> validation: Pass tx pool reference into CheckSequenceLocks (MarcoFalke)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14834\">#14834</a> validation: Assert that pindexPrev is non-null when required (kallewoof)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14085\">#14085</a> index: Fix for indexers skipping genesis block (jimpo)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14963\">#14963</a> mempool, validation: Explain <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">cs_main</code> locking semantics (MarcoFalke)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15193\">#15193</a> Default <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-whitelistforcerelay</code> to off (sdaftuar)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15429\">#15429</a> Update <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">assumevalid</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">minimumchainwork</code>, and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getchaintxstats</code> to height 563378 (gmaxwell)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15552\">#15552</a> Granular invalidateblock and RewindBlockIndex (MarcoFalke)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14841\">#14841</a> Move CheckBlock() call to critical section (hebasto)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"p2p-protocol-and-network-code\">P2P protocol and network code</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14025\">#14025</a> Remove dead code for nVersion=10300 (MarcoFalke)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12254\">#12254</a> BIP 158: Compact Block Filters for Light Clients (jimpo)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14073\">#14073</a> blockfilter: Avoid out-of-bounds script access (jimpo)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14140\">#14140</a> Switch nPrevNodeCount to vNodesSize (pstratem)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14027\">#14027</a> Skip stale tip checking if outbound connections are off or if reindexing (gmaxwell)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14532\">#14532</a> Never bind <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">INADDR_ANY</code> by default, and warn when doing so explicitly (luke-jr)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14733\">#14733</a> Make peer timeout configurable, speed up very slow test and ensure correct code path tested (zallarak)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14336\">#14336</a> Implement poll (pstratem)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15051\">#15051</a> IsReachable is the inverse of IsLimited (DRY).

Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac)\nor bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).\nIf your node has a txindex, the txindex db will be migrated the first time you run 0.17.0 or newer, which may take up to a few hours. Your node will not be functional until this migration completes.\nThe first time you run version 0.15.0 or newer, your chainstate database will be converted to a\nnew format, which will take anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour,\ndepending on the speed of your machine.\nNote that the block database format also changed in version 0.8.0 and there is no\nautomatic upgrade code from before version 0.8 to version 0.15.0. Upgrading\ndirectly from 0.7.x and earlier without redownloading the blockchain is not supported.\nHowever, as usual, old wallet versions are still supported.\nDowngrading warning\nThe chainstate database for this release is not compatible with previous\nreleases, so if you run 0.15 and then decide to switch back to any\nolder version, you will need to run the old release with the -reindex-chainstate\noption to rebuild the chainstate data structures in the old format.\nIf your node has pruning enabled, this will entail re-downloading and\nprocessing the entire blockchain.\nCompatibility\nBitcoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using\nthe Linux kernel, macOS 10.10+, and Windows 7 and newer (Windows XP is not supported).\nBitcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not\nfrequently tested on them.\nFrom 0.17.0 onwards macOS <10.10 is no longer supported. 0.17.0 is built using Qt 5.9.x, which doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nsupport versions of macOS older than 10.10.\nNotable changes\nlisttransactions label support\nThe listtransactions RPC account parameter which was deprecated in 0.17.0\nand renamed to dummy has been un-deprecated and renamed again to label.\nWhen bitcoin is configured with the -deprecatedrpc=accounts setting, specifying\na label/account/dummy argument will return both outgoing and incoming\ntransactions.

Your node will not be functional until this migration completes.</p>\n<p>The first time you run version 0.15.0 or newer, your chainstate database will be converted to a\nnew format, which will take anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour,\ndepending on the speed of your machine.</p>\n<p>Note that the block database format also changed in version 0.8.0 and there is no\nautomatic upgrade code from before version 0.8 to version 0.15.0. Upgrading\ndirectly from 0.7.x and earlier without redownloading the blockchain is not supported.\nHowever, as usual, old wallet versions are still supported.</p>\n<h2 id=\"downgrading-warning\">Downgrading warning</h2>\n<p>The chainstate database for this release is not compatible with previous\nreleases, so if you run 0.15 and then decide to switch back to any\nolder version, you will need to run the old release with the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-reindex-chainstate</code>\noption to rebuild the chainstate data structures in the old format.</p>\n<p>If your node has pruning enabled, this will entail re-downloading and\nprocessing the entire blockchain.</p>\n<h1 id=\"compatibility\">Compatibility</h1>\n<p>Bitcoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using\nthe Linux kernel, macOS 10.10+, and Windows 7 and newer (Windows XP is not supported).</p>\n<p>Bitcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not\nfrequently tested on them.</p>\n<p>From 0.17.0 onwards macOS &lt;10.10 is no longer supported. 0.17.0 is built using Qt 5.9.x, which doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nsupport versions of macOS older than 10.10.</p>\n<h1 id=\"notable-changes\">Notable changes</h1>\n<h2 id=\"listtransactions-label-support\"><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">listtransactions</code> label support</h2>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">listtransactions</code> RPC <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">account</code> parameter which was deprecated in 0.17.0\nand renamed to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">dummy</code> has been un-deprecated and renamed again to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">label</code>.</p>\n<p>When bitcoin is configured with the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-deprecatedrpc=accounts</code> setting, specifying\na label/account/dummy argument will return both outgoing and incoming\ntransactions.

Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac)\nor bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).\nIf your node has a txindex, the txindex db will be migrated the first time you run 0.17.0 or newer, which may take up to a few hours. Your node will not be functional until this migration completes.\nThe first time you run version 0.15.0 or newer, your chainstate database will be converted to a\nnew format, which will take anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour,\ndepending on the speed of your machine.\nNote that the block database format also changed in version 0.8.0 and there is no\nautomatic upgrade code from before version 0.8 to version 0.15.0. Upgrading\ndirectly from 0.7.x and earlier without redownloading the blockchain is not supported.\nHowever, as usual, old wallet versions are still supported.\nDowngrading warning\nThe chainstate database for this release is not compatible with previous\nreleases, so if you run 0.15 and then decide to switch back to any\nolder version, you will need to run the old release with the -reindex-chainstate\noption to rebuild the chainstate data structures in the old format.\nIf your node has pruning enabled, this will entail re-downloading and\nprocessing the entire blockchain.\nCompatibility\nBitcoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using\nthe Linux kernel, macOS 10.10+, and Windows 7 and newer (Windows XP is not supported).\nBitcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not\nfrequently tested on them.\nFrom 0.17.0 onwards macOS <10.10 is no longer supported. 0.17.0 is built using Qt 5.9.x, which doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nsupport versions of macOS older than 10.10.\nKnown issues\n\n\nUpgrading from 0.13.0 or older currently results in memory blow-up during the roll-back of blocks to the SegWit activation point. In these cases, a full -reindex is necessary.\n\n\nThe GUI suffers from visual glitches in the new MacOS dark mode. This has to do with our Qt theme handling and is not a new problem in 0.17.0, but is expected to be resolved in 0.17.1.\n\n\nNotable changes\nChanged configuration options\n\n\n-includeconf=<file> can be used to include additional configuration files.\nOnly works inside the bitcoin.conf file, not inside included files or from\ncommand-line. Multiple files may be included. Can be disabled from command-\nline via -noincludeconf. Note that multi-argument commands like\n-includeconf will override preceding -noincludeconf, i.e.\nnoincludeconf=1\nincludeconf=relative.conf\n \nas bitcoin.conf will still include relative.conf.\n\n\nGUI changes\n\nBlock storage can be limited under Preferences, in the Main tab. Undoing this setting requires downloading the full blockchain again. This mode is incompatible with -txindex and -rescan.\n\nExternal wallet files\nThe -wallet=<path> option now accepts full paths instead of requiring wallets\nto be located in the -walletdir directory.\nNewly created wallet format\nIf -wallet=<path> is specified with a path that does not exist, it will now\ncreate a wallet directory at the specified location (containing a wallet.dat\ndata file, a db.log file, and database/log.?????????? files) instead of just\ncreating a data file at the path and storing log files in the parent\ndirectory. This should make backing up wallets more straightforward than\nbefore because the specified wallet path can just be directly archived without\nhaving to look in the parent directory for transaction log files.\nFor backwards compatibility, wallet paths that are names of existing data files\nin the -walletdir directory will continue to be accepted and interpreted the\nsame as before.\nDynamic loading and creation of wallets\nPreviously, wallets could only be loaded or created at startup, by specifying -wallet parameters on the command line or in the bitcoin.conf file. It is now possible to load, create and unload wallets dynamically at runtime:\n\nExisting wallets can be loaded by calling the loadwallet RPC. The wallet can be specified as file/directory basename (which must be located in the walletdir directory), or as an absolute path to a file/directory.\nNew wallets can be created (and loaded) by calling the createwallet RPC. The provided name must not match a wallet file in the walletdir directory or the name of a wallet that is currently loaded.\nLoaded wallets can be unloaded by calling the unloadwallet RPC.\n\nThis feature is currently only available through the RPC interface.\nCoin selection\nPartial spend avoidance\nWhen an address is paid multiple times the coins from those separate payments can be spent separately which hurts privacy due to linking otherwise separate addresses. A new -avoidpartialspends flag has been added (default=false). If enabled, the wallet will always spend existing UTXO to the same address together even if it results in higher fees. If someone were to send coins to an address after it was used, those coins will still be included in future coin selections.\nConfiguration sections for testnet and regtest\nIt is now possible for a single configuration file to set different\noptions for different networks. This is done by using sections or by\nprefixing the option with the network, such as:\nmain.uacomment=bitcoin\ntest.uacomment=bitcoin-testnet\nregtest.uacomment=regtest\n[main]\nmempoolsize=300\n[test]\nmempoolsize=100\n[regtest]\nmempoolsize=20\n\nIf the following options are not in a section, they will only apply to mainnet:\naddnode=, connect=, port=, bind=, rpcport=, rpcbind= and wallet=.\nThe options to choose a network (regtest= and testnet=) must be specified\noutside of sections.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098label\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and \u00e2\u0080\u0098account\u00e2\u0080\u0099 APIs for wallet\nA new \u00e2\u0080\u0098label\u00e2\u0080\u0099 API has been introduced for the wallet. This is intended as a\nreplacement for the deprecated \u00e2\u0080\u0098account\u00e2\u0080\u0099 API. The \u00e2\u0080\u0098account\u00e2\u0080\u0099 can continue to\nbe used in V0.17 by starting bitcoind with the \u00e2\u0080\u0098-deprecatedrpc=accounts\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nargument, and will be fully removed in V0.18.\nThe label RPC methods mirror the account functionality, with the following functional differences:\n\nLabels can be set on any address, not just receiving addresses. This functionality was previously only available through the GUI.\nLabels can be deleted by reassigning all addresses using the setlabel RPC method.\nThere isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t support for sending transactions from a label, or for determining which label a transaction was sent from.\nLabels do not have a balance.\n\nHere are the changes to RPC methods:\n\n\n\nDeprecated Method\nNew Method\nNotes\n\n\n\n\ngetaccount\ngetaddressinfo\ngetaddressinfo returns a json object with address information instead of just the name of the account as a string.\n\n\ngetaccountaddress\nn/a\nThere is no replacement for getaccountaddress since labels do not have an associated receive address.\n\n\ngetaddressesbyaccount\ngetaddressesbylabel\ngetaddressesbylabel returns a json object with the addresses as keys, instead of a list of strings.\n\n\ngetreceivedbyaccount\ngetreceivedbylabel\nno change in behavior\n\n\nlistaccounts\nlistlabels\nlistlabels does not return a balance or accept minconf and watchonly arguments.\n\n\nlistreceivedbyaccount\nlistreceivedbylabel\nBoth methods return new label fields, along with account fields for backward compatibility.\n\n\nmove\nn/a\nno replacement\n\n\nsendfrom\nn/a\nno replacement\n\n\nsetaccount\nsetlabel\nBoth methods now:\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 allow assigning labels to any address, instead of raising an error if the address is not receiving address.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 delete the previous label associated with an address when the final address using that label is reassigned to a different label, instead of making an implicit getaccountaddress call to ensure the previous label still has a receiving address.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanged Method\nNotes\n\n\n\n\naddmultisigaddress\nRenamed account named parameter to label. Still accepts account for backward compatibility if running with \u00e2\u0080\u0098-deprecatedrpc=accounts\u00e2\u0080\u0099.\n\n\ngetnewaddress\nRenamed account named parameter to label. Still accepts account for backward compatibility. if running with \u00e2\u0080\u0098-deprecatedrpc=accounts\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\nlistunspent\nReturns new label fields. account field will be returned for backward compatibility if running with \u00e2\u0080\u0098-deprecatedrpc=accounts\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\nsendmany\nThe account named parameter has been renamed to dummy. If provided, the dummy parameter must be set to the empty string, unless running with the -deprecatedrpc=accounts argument (in which case functionality is unchanged).\n\n\nlisttransactions\nThe account named parameter has been renamed to dummy. If provided, the dummy parameter must be set to the string *, unless running with the -deprecatedrpc=accounts argument (in which case functionality is unchanged).\n\n\ngetbalance\naccount, minconf and include_watchonly parameters are deprecated, and can only be used if running with \u00e2\u0080\u0098-deprecatedrpc=accounts\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\nBIP 174 Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions support\nBIP 174 PSBT is an interchange format for Bitcoin transactions that are not fully signed\nyet, together with relevant metadata to help entities work towards signing it.\nIt is intended to simplify workflows where multiple parties need to cooperate to\nproduce a transaction. Examples include hardware wallets, multisig setups, and\nCoinJoin transactions.\nOverall workflow\nOverall, the construction of a fully signed Bitcoin transaction goes through the\nfollowing steps:\n\nA Creator proposes a particular transaction to be created. He constructs\na PSBT that contains certain inputs and outputs, but no additional metadata.\nFor each input, an Updater adds information about the UTXOs being spent by\nthe transaction to the PSBT.\nA potentially other Updater adds information about the scripts and public keys\ninvolved in each of the inputs (and possibly outputs) of the PSBT.\nSigners inspect the transaction and its metadata to decide whether they\nagree with the transaction. They can use amount information from the UTXOs\nto assess the values and fees involved. If they agree, they produce a\npartial signature for the inputs for which they have relevant key(s).\nA Finalizer is run for each input to convert the partial signatures and\npossibly script information into a final scriptSig and/or scriptWitness.\nAn Extractor produces a valid Bitcoin transaction (in network format)\nfrom a PSBT for which all inputs are finalized.\n\nGenerally, each of the above (excluding Creator and Extractor) will simply\nadd more and more data to a particular PSBT. In a naive workflow, they all have\nto operate sequentially, passing the PSBT from one to the next, until the\nExtractor can convert it to a real transaction. In order to permit parallel\noperation, Combiners can be employed which merge metadata from different\nPSBTs for the same unsigned transaction.\nThe names above in bold are the names of the roles defined in BIP174. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re\nuseful in understanding the underlying steps, but in practice, software and\nhardware implementations will typically implement multiple roles simultaneously.\nRPCs\n\nconverttopsbt (Creator) is a utility RPC that converts an\nunsigned raw transaction to PSBT format. It ignores existing signatures.\ncreatepsbt (Creator) is a utility RPC that takes a list of inputs and\noutputs and converts them to a PSBT with no additional information. It is\nequivalent to calling createrawtransaction followed by converttopsbt.\nwalletcreatefundedpsbt (Creator, Updater) is a wallet RPC that creates a\nPSBT with the specified inputs and outputs, adds additional inputs and change\nto it to balance it out, and adds relevant metadata. In particular, for inputs\nthat the wallet knows about (counting towards its normal or watch-only\nbalance), UTXO information will be added. For outputs and inputs with UTXO\ninformation present, key and script information will be added which the wallet\nknows about. It is equivalent to running createrawtransaction, followed by\nfundrawtransaction, and converttopsbt.\nwalletprocesspsbt (Updater, Signer, Finalizer) is a wallet RPC that takes as\ninput a PSBT, adds UTXO, key, and script data to inputs and outputs that miss\nit, and optionally signs inputs. Where possible it also finalizes the partial\nsignatures.\nfinalizepsbt (Finalizer, Extractor) is a utility RPC that finalizes any\npartial signatures, and if all inputs are finalized, converts the result to a\nfully signed transaction which can be broadcast with sendrawtransaction.\ncombinepsbt (Combiner) is a utility RPC that implements a Combiner. It\ncan be used at any point in the workflow to merge information added to\ndifferent versions of the same PSBT. In particular it is useful to combine the\noutput of multiple Updaters or Signers.\ndecodepsbt is a diagnostic utility RPC which will show all information in\na PSBT in human-readable form, as well as compute its eventual fee if known.\n\nUpgrading non-HD wallets to HD wallets\nSince Bitcoin Core 0.13.0, creating new BIP 32 Hierarchical Deterministic wallets has been supported by Bitcoin Core but old non-HD wallets could not be upgraded to HD. Now non-HD wallets can be upgraded to HD using the -upgradewallet command line option. This upgrade will result in the all keys in the keypool being marked as used and a new keypool generated. A new backup must be made when this upgrade is performed.\nAdditionally, -upgradewallet can be used to upgraded from a non-split HD chain (all keys generated with m/0'/0'/i') to a split HD chain (receiving keys generated with 'm/0'/0'/i' and change keys generated with m'/0'/1'/i'). When this upgrade occurs, all keys already in the keypool will remain in the keypool to be used until all keys from before the upgrade are exhausted. This is to avoid issues with backups and downgrades when some keys may come from the change key keypool. Users can begin using the new split HD chain keypools by using the newkeypool RPC to mark all keys in the keypool as used and begin using a new keypool generated from the split HD chain.\nHD Master key rotation\nA new RPC, sethdseed, has been introduced which allows users to set a new HD seed or set their own HD seed. This allows for a new HD seed to be used. A new backup must be made when a new HD seed is set.\nLow-level RPC changes\n\n\nThe new RPC scantxoutset can be used to scan the UTXO set for entries\nthat match certain output descriptors. Refer to the output descriptors\nreference documentation for more details. This call\nis similar to listunspent but does not use a wallet, meaning that the\nwallet can be disabled at compile or run time. This call is experimental,\nas such, is subject to changes or removal in future releases.\n\nThe createrawtransaction RPC will now accept an array or dictionary (kept for compatibility) for the outputs parameter. This means the order of transaction outputs can be specified by the client.\nThe fundrawtransaction RPC will reject the previously deprecated reserveChangeKey option.\nsendmany now shuffles outputs to improve privacy, so any previously expected behavior with regards to output ordering can no longer be relied upon.\nThe new RPC testmempoolaccept can be used to test acceptance of a transaction to the mempool without adding it.\nJSON transaction decomposition now includes a weight field which provides\nthe transaction\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exact weight. This is included in REST /rest/tx/ and\n/rest/block/ endpoints when in json mode. This is also included in getblock\n(with verbosity=2), listsinceblock, listtransactions, and\ngetrawtransaction RPC commands.\nNew fees field introduced in getrawmempool, getmempoolancestors, getmempooldescendants and\n getmempoolentry when verbosity is set to true with sub-fields ancestor, base, modified\n and descendant denominated in BTC. This new field deprecates previous fee fields, such as\n fee, modifiedfee, ancestorfee and descendantfee.\nThe new RPC getzmqnotifications returns information about active ZMQ\nnotifications.\nWhen bitcoin is not started with any -wallet=<path> options, the name of\nthe default wallet returned by getwalletinfo and listwallets RPCs is\nnow the empty string \"\" instead of \"wallet.dat\". If bitcoin is started\nwith any -wallet=<path> options, there is no change in behavior, and the\nname of any wallet is just its <path> string.\n\nPassing an empty string (\"\") as the address_type parameter to\ngetnewaddress, getrawchangeaddress, addmultisigaddress,\nfundrawtransaction RPCs is now an error. Previously, this would fall back\nto using the default address type. It is still possible to pass null or leave\nthe parameter unset to use the default address type.\n\n\nBare multisig outputs to our keys are no longer automatically treated as\nincoming payments. As this feature was only available for multisig outputs for\nwhich you had all private keys in your wallet, there was generally no use for\nthem compared to single-key schemes. Furthermore, no address format for such\noutputs is defined, and wallet software can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t easily send to it. These outputs\nwill no longer show up in listtransactions, listunspent, or contribute to\nyour balance, unless they are explicitly watched (using importaddress or\nimportmulti with hex script argument). signrawtransaction* also still\nworks for them.\n\nThe getwalletinfo RPC method now returns an hdseedid value, which is always the same as the incorrectly-named hdmasterkeyid value. hdmasterkeyid will be removed in V0.18.\n\nThe getaddressinfo RPC method now returns an hdseedid value, which is always the same as the incorrectly-named hdmasterkeyid value. hdmasterkeyid will be removed in V0.18.\n\nParts of the validateaddress RPC method have been deprecated and moved to\ngetaddressinfo. Clients must transition to using getaddressinfo to access\nthis information before upgrading to v0.18. The following deprecated fields\nhave moved to getaddressinfo and will only be shown with\n-deprecatedrpc=validateaddress: ismine, iswatchonly, script, hex,\npubkeys, sigsrequired, pubkey, addresses, embedded, iscompressed,\naccount, timestamp, hdkeypath, hdmasterkeyid.\nsignrawtransaction is deprecated and will be fully removed in v0.18. To use\nsignrawtransaction in v0.17, restart bitcoind with\n-deprecatedrpc=signrawtransaction. Projects should transition to using\nsignrawtransactionwithkey and signrawtransactionwithwallet before\nupgrading to v0.18.\n\nOther API changes\n\nThe inactivehdmaster property in the dumpwallet output has been corrected to inactivehdseed\n\nLogging\n\n\nThe log timestamp format is now ISO 8601 (e.g. \u00e2\u0080\u009c2018-02-28T12:34:56Z\u00e2\u0080\u009d).\n\n\nWhen running bitcoind with -debug but without -daemon, logging to stdout\nis now the default behavior. Setting -printtoconsole=1 no longer implicitly\ndisables logging to debug.log. Instead, logging to file can be explicitly disabled\nby setting -debuglogfile=0.\n\n\nTransaction index changes\nThe transaction index is now built separately from the main node procedure,\nmeaning the -txindex flag can be toggled without a full reindex. If bitcoind\nis run with -txindex on a node that is already partially or fully synced\nwithout one, the transaction index will be built in the background and become\navailable once caught up. When switching from running -txindex to running\nwithout the flag, the transaction index database will not be deleted\nautomatically, meaning it could be turned back on at a later time without a full\nresync.\nMiner block size removed\nThe -blockmaxsize option for miners to limit their blocks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sizes was\ndeprecated in V0.15.1, and has now been removed. Miners should use the\n-blockmaxweight option if they want to limit the weight of their blocks.\nPython Support\nSupport for Python 2 has been discontinued for all test files and tools.\n0.17.0 change

Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt</code> (on Mac)\nor <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoind</code>/<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin-qt</code> (on Linux).</p>\n<p>If your node has a txindex, the txindex db will be migrated the first time you run 0.17.0 or newer, which may take up to a few hours. Your node will not be functional until this migration completes.</p>\n<p>The first time you run version 0.15.0 or newer, your chainstate database will be converted to a\nnew format, which will take anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour,\ndepending on the speed of your machine.</p>\n<p>Note that the block database format also changed in version 0.8.0 and there is no\nautomatic upgrade code from before version 0.8 to version 0.15.0. Upgrading\ndirectly from 0.7.x and earlier without redownloading the blockchain is not supported.\nHowever, as usual, old wallet versions are still supported.</p>\n<h2 id=\"downgrading-warning\">Downgrading warning</h2>\n<p>The chainstate database for this release is not compatible with previous\nreleases, so if you run 0.15 and then decide to switch back to any\nolder version, you will need to run the old release with the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-reindex-chainstate</code>\noption to rebuild the chainstate data structures in the old format.</p>\n<p>If your node has pruning enabled, this will entail re-downloading and\nprocessing the entire blockchain.</p>\n<h1 id=\"compatibility\">Compatibility</h1>\n<p>Bitcoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using\nthe Linux kernel, macOS 10.10+, and Windows 7 and newer (Windows XP is not supported).</p>\n<p>Bitcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not\nfrequently tested on them.</p>\n<p>From 0.17.0 onwards macOS &lt;10.10 is no longer supported. 0.17.0 is built using Qt 5.9.x, which doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nsupport versions of macOS older than 10.10.</p>\n<h1 id=\"known-issues\">Known issues</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Upgrading from 0.13.0 or older currently results in memory blow-up during the roll-back of blocks to the SegWit activation point. In these cases, a full <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-reindex</code> is necessary.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The GUI suffers from visual glitches in the new MacOS dark mode. This has to do with our Qt theme handling and is not a new problem in 0.17.0, but is expected to be resolved in 0.17.1.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"notable-changes\">Notable changes</h1>\n<h2 id=\"changed-configuration-options\">Changed configuration options</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-includeconf=&lt;file&gt;</code> can be used to include additional configuration files.\nOnly works inside the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin.conf</code> file, not inside included files or from\ncommand-line. Multiple files may be included. Can be disabled from command-\nline via <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-noincludeconf</code>. Note that multi-argument commands like\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-includeconf</code> will override preceding <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-noincludeconf</code>, i.e.</p>\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>noincludeconf=1\nincludeconf=relative.conf\n</code></pre></div> </div>\n<p>as bitcoin.conf will still include <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">relative.conf</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"gui-changes\">GUI changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Block storage can be limited under Preferences, in the Main tab. Undoing this setting requires downloading the full blockchain again. This mode is incompatible with -txindex and -rescan.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"external-wallet-files\">External wallet files</h2>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-wallet=&lt;path&gt;</code> option now accepts full paths instead of requiring wallets\nto be located in the -walletdir directory.</p>\n<h2 id=\"newly-created-wallet-format\">Newly created wallet format</h2>\n<p>If <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-wallet=&lt;path&gt;</code> is specified with a path that does not exist, it will now\ncreate a wallet directory at the specified location (containing a wallet.dat\ndata file, a db.log file, and database/log.?????????? files) instead of just\ncreating a data file at the path and storing log files in the parent\ndirectory. This should make backing up wallets more straightforward than\nbefore because the specified wallet path can just be directly archived without\nhaving to look in the parent directory for transaction log files.</p>\n<p>For backwards compatibility, wallet paths that are names of existing data files\nin the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-walletdir</code> directory will continue to be accepted and interpreted the\nsame as before.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dynamic-loading-and-creation-of-wallets\">Dynamic loading and creation of wallets</h2>\n<p>Previously, wallets could only be loaded or created at startup, by specifying <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-wallet</code> parameters on the command line or in the bitcoin.conf file. It is now possible to load, create and unload wallets dynamically at runtime:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Existing wallets can be loaded by calling the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">loadwallet</code> RPC. The wallet can be specified as file/directory basename (which must be located in the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">walletdir</code> directory), or as an absolute path to a file/directory.</li>\n<li>New wallets can be created (and loaded) by calling the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">createwallet</code> RPC. The provided name must not match a wallet file in the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">walletdir</code> directory or the name of a wallet that is currently loaded.</li>\n<li>Loaded wallets can be unloaded by calling the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">unloadwallet</code> RPC.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This feature is currently only available through the RPC interface.</p>\n<h2 id=\"coin-selection\">Coin selection</h2>\n<h3 id=\"partial-spend-avoidance\">Partial spend avoidance</h3>\n<p>When an address is paid multiple times the coins from those separate payments can be spent separately which hurts privacy due to linking otherwise separate addresses. A new <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-avoidpartialspends</code> flag has been added (default=false). If enabled, the wallet will always spend existing UTXO to the same address together even if it results in higher fees. If someone were to send coins to an address after it was used, those coins will still be included in future coin selections.</p>\n<h2 id=\"configuration-sections-for-testnet-and-regtest\">Configuration sections for testnet and regtest</h2>\n<p>It is now possible for a single configuration file to set different\noptions for different networks. This is done by using sections or by\nprefixing the option with the network, such as:</p>\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>main.uacomment=bitcoin\ntest.uacomment=bitcoin-testnet\nregtest.uacomment=regtest\n[main]\nmempoolsize=300\n[test]\nmempoolsize=100\n[regtest]\nmempoolsize=20\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>If the following options are not in a section, they will only apply to mainnet:\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">addnode=</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">connect=</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">port=</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bind=</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">rpcport=</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">rpcbind=</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">wallet=</code>.\nThe options to choose a network (<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">regtest=</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">testnet=</code>) must be specified\noutside of sections.</p>\n<h2 id=\"label-and-account-apis-for-wallet\">\u00e2\u0080\u0098label\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and \u00e2\u0080\u0098account\u00e2\u0080\u0099 APIs for wallet</h2>\n<p>A new \u00e2\u0080\u0098label\u00e2\u0080\u0099 API has been introduced for the wallet.

Examples include hardware wallets, multisig setups, and\n<a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/?topic=279249\">CoinJoin</a> transactions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"overall-workflow\">Overall workflow</h3>\n<p>Overall, the construction of a fully signed Bitcoin transaction goes through the\nfollowing steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <strong>Creator</strong> proposes a particular transaction to be created. He constructs\na PSBT that contains certain inputs and outputs, but no additional metadata.</li>\n<li>For each input, an <strong>Updater</strong> adds information about the UTXOs being spent by\nthe transaction to the PSBT.</li>\n<li>A potentially other Updater adds information about the scripts and public keys\ninvolved in each of the inputs (and possibly outputs) of the PSBT.</li>\n<li><strong>Signers</strong> inspect the transaction and its metadata to decide whether they\nagree with the transaction. They can use amount information from the UTXOs\nto assess the values and fees involved. If they agree, they produce a\npartial signature for the inputs for which they have relevant key(s).</li>\n<li>A <strong>Finalizer</strong> is run for each input to convert the partial signatures and\npossibly script information into a final <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">scriptSig</code> and/or <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">scriptWitness</code>.</li>\n<li>An <strong>Extractor</strong> produces a valid Bitcoin transaction (in network format)\nfrom a PSBT for which all inputs are finalized.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Generally, each of the above (excluding Creator and Extractor) will simply\nadd more and more data to a particular PSBT. In a naive workflow, they all have\nto operate sequentially, passing the PSBT from one to the next, until the\nExtractor can convert it to a real transaction. In order to permit parallel\noperation, <strong>Combiners</strong> can be employed which merge metadata from different\nPSBTs for the same unsigned transaction.</p>\n<p>The names above in bold are the names of the roles defined in BIP174. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re\nuseful in understanding the underlying steps, but in practice, software and\nhardware implementations will typically implement multiple roles simultaneously.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rpcs\">RPCs</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">converttopsbt</code> (Creator)</strong> is a utility RPC that converts an\nunsigned raw transaction to PSBT format. It ignores existing signatures.</li>\n<li><strong><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">createpsbt</code> (Creator)</strong> is a utility RPC that takes a list of inputs and\noutputs and converts them to a PSBT with no additional information. It is\nequivalent to calling <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">createrawtransaction</code> followed by <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">converttopsbt</code>.</li>\n<li><strong><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">walletcreatefundedpsbt</code> (Creator, Updater)</strong> is a wallet RPC that creates a\nPSBT with the specified inputs and outputs, adds additional inputs and change\nto it to balance it out, and adds relevant metadata. In particular, for inputs\nthat the wallet knows about (counting towards its normal or watch-only\nbalance), UTXO information will be added. For outputs and inputs with UTXO\ninformation present, key and script information will be added which the wallet\nknows about. It is equivalent to running <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">createrawtransaction</code>, followed by\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">fundrawtransaction</code>, and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">converttopsbt</code>.</li>\n<li><strong><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">walletprocesspsbt</code> (Updater, Signer, Finalizer)</strong> is a wallet RPC that takes as\ninput a PSBT, adds UTXO, key, and script data to inputs and outputs that miss\nit, and optionally signs inputs. Where possible it also finalizes the partial\nsignatures.</li>\n<li><strong><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">finalizepsbt</code> (Finalizer, Extractor)</strong> is a utility RPC that finalizes any\npartial signatures, and if all inputs are finalized, converts the result to a\nfully signed transaction which can be broadcast with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">sendrawtransaction</code>.</li>\n<li><strong><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">combinepsbt</code> (Combiner)</strong> is a utility RPC that implements a Combiner. It\ncan be used at any point in the workflow to merge information added to\ndifferent versions of the same PSBT. In particular it is useful to combine the\noutput of multiple Updaters or Signers.</li>\n<li><strong><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">decodepsbt</code></strong> is a diagnostic utility RPC which will show all information in\na PSBT in human-readable form, as well as compute its eventual fee if known.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"upgrading-non-hd-wallets-to-hd-wallets\">Upgrading non-HD wallets to HD wallets</h2>\n<p>Since Bitcoin Core 0.13.0, creating new BIP 32 Hierarchical Deterministic wallets has been supported by Bitcoin Core but old non-HD wallets could not be upgraded to HD. Now non-HD wallets can be upgraded to HD using the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-upgradewallet</code> command line option. This upgrade will result in the all keys in the keypool being marked as used and a new keypool generated. <strong>A new backup must be made when this upgrade is performed.</strong></p>\n<p>Additionally, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-upgradewallet</code> can be used to upgraded from a non-split HD chain (all keys generated with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">m/0'/0'/i'</code>) to a split HD chain (receiving keys generated with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">'m/0'/0'/i'</code> and change keys generated with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">m'/0'/1'/i'</code>). When this upgrade occurs, all keys already in the keypool will remain in the keypool to be used until all keys from before the upgrade are exhausted. This is to avoid issues with backups and downgrades when some keys may come from the change key keypool. Users can begin using the new split HD chain keypools by using the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">newkeypool</code> RPC to mark all keys in the keypool as used and begin using a new keypool generated from the split HD chain.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hd-master-key-rotation\">HD Master key rotation</h2>\n<p>A new RPC, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">sethdseed</code>, has been introduced which allows users to set a new HD seed or set their own HD seed.

Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac)\nor bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).\nThe first time you run version 0.15.0 or newer, your chainstate database will be converted to a\nnew format, which will take anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour,\ndepending on the speed of your machine.\nNote that the block database format also changed in version 0.8.0 and there is no\nautomatic upgrade code from before version 0.8 to version 0.15.0 or higher. Upgrading\ndirectly from 0.7.x and earlier without re-downloading the blockchain is not supported.\nHowever, as usual, old wallet versions are still supported.\nDowngrading warning\nWallets created in 0.16 and later are not compatible with versions prior to 0.16\nand will not work if you try to use newly created wallets in older versions. Existing\nwallets that were created with older versions are not affected by this.\nCompatibility\nBitcoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using\nthe Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later. Windows XP is not supported.\nBitcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not\nfrequently tested on them.\nNotable changes\nDenial-of-Service vulnerability\nA denial-of-service vulnerability exploitable by miners has been discovered in\nBitcoin Core versions 0.14.0 up to 0.16.2. It is recommended to upgrade any of\nthe vulnerable versions to 0.16.3 as soon as possible.\n0.16.3 change log\nConsensus\n\n#14249 696b936 Fix crash bug with duplicate inputs within a transaction (TheBlueMatt, sdaftuar)\n\nRPC and other APIs\n\n#13547 212ef1f Make signrawtransaction* give an error when amount is needed but missing (ajtowns)\n\nMiscellaneous\n\n#13655 1cdbea7 bitcoinconsensus: invalid flags error should be set to bitcoinconsensus_err (afk11)\n\nDocumentation\n\n#13844 11b9dbb correct the help output for -prune (hebasto)\n\nCredits\nThanks to everyone who directly contributed to this release:\n\nAnthony Towns\nHennadii Stepanov\nMatt Corallo\nSuhas Daftuar\nThomas Kerin\nWladimir J. van der Laan\n\nAnd to those that reported security issues:\n\nbeardnboobies\n\nAs well as everyone that helped translating on Transifex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\nLegal | Privacy Policy | RSS \n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2025 Bitcoin Core\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<!--[if lt IE 7]><html class=\"no-js lt-ie9 lt-ie8 lt-ie7\" lang=\"en\"> <![endif]-->\n<!--[if (IE 7)&!(IEMobile)]><html class=\"no-js lt-ie9 lt-ie8\" lang=\"en\"><![endif]-->\n<!--[if (IE 8)&!(IEMobile)]><html class=\"no-js lt-ie9\" lang=\"en\"><![endif]-->\n<!--[if gt IE 8]><!--> <html class=\"no-js\" lang=\"en\"><!--<![endif]-->\n<head>\n<!-- source: '_releases/0.16.3.md' -->\n<!-- name: 'release-0.16.3' -->\n<!-- version:  -->\n<!-- translated:  -->\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\"/>\n<title>Bitcoin Core :: Bitcoin Core 0.16.3</title>\n<meta content=\"Bitcoin Core 0.16.3\" name=\"description\"/>\n<meta content=\"\" name=\"keywords\"/>\n<meta content=\"http://6hasakffvppilxgehrswmffqurlcjjjhd76jgvaqmsg6ul25s7t3rzyd.onion/en/releases/0.16.3/\" http-equiv=\"onion-location\">\n<!-- Twitter Cards -->\n<meta content=\"Bitcoin Core 0.16.3\" name=\"twitter:title\"/>\n<meta content=\"Bitcoin Core 0.16.3\" name=\"twitter:description\"/>\n<meta content=\"@bitcoincoreorg\" name=\"twitter:site\"/>\n<meta content=\"@bitcoincoreorg\" name=\"twitter:creator\"/>\n<meta content=\"summary\" name=\"twitter:card\"/>\n<meta content=\"https://bitcoincore.org/assets/images/default-thumb.png\" name=\"twitter:image\"/>\n<!-- Open Graph -->\n<meta content=\"en\" property=\"og:locale\"/>\n<meta content=\"article\" property=\"og:type\"/>\n<meta content=\"Bitcoin Core 0.16.3\" property=\"og:title\"/>\n<meta content=\"Bitcoin Core 0.16.3\" property=\"og:description\"/>\n<meta content=\"https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/0.16.3/\" property=\"og:url\"/>\n<meta content=\"Bitcoin Core\" property=\"og:site_name\"/>\n<meta content=\"https://bitcoincore.org/assets/images/default-thumb.png\" property=\"og:image\"/>\n<link href=\"https://bitcoincore.org/ja/releases/0.16.3/\" hreflang=\"ja\" rel=\"alternate\"/>\n<link href=\"https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/0.16.3/\" rel=\"canonical\"/>\n<link href=\"https://bitcoincore.org/en/feed.xml\" rel=\"alternate\" title=\"Bitcoin Core Blog XML Feed\" type=\"application/atom+xml\"/>\n<link href=\"https://bitcoincore.org/en/rss.xml\" rel=\"alternate\" title=\"Bitcoin Core Blog RSS Feed\" type=\"application/rss+xml\"/>\n<link href=\"https://bitcoincore.org/en/meetingrss.xml\" rel=\"alternate\" title=\"Bitcoin Core Meeting RSS Feed\" type=\"application/rss+xml\"/>\n<!-- http://t.co/dKP3o1e -->\n<meta content=\"True\" name=\"HandheldFriendly\"/>\n<meta content=\"320\" name=\"MobileOptimized\"/>\n<meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\" name=\"viewport\"/>\n<!-- For all browsers -->\n<link href=\"/assets/css/main.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\"/>\n<meta content=\"on\" http-equiv=\"cleartype\"/>\n<!-- Icons -->\n<link href=\"/assets/images/favicon.ico\" rel=\"shortcut icon\"/><!-- 16x16 -->\n<link href=\"/assets/images/favicon.png\" rel=\"shortcut icon\"/><!-- 32x32 -->\n<link href=\"/assets/images/apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png\" rel=\"apple-touch-icon-precomposed\"/><!-- 57x57 (precomposed) for iPhone 3GS, pre-2011 iPod Touch and older Android devices -->\n<link href=\"/assets/images/apple-touch-icon-72x72-precomposed.png\" rel=\"apple-touch-icon-precomposed\" sizes=\"72x72\"/><!-- 72x72 (precomposed) for 1st generation iPad, iPad 2 and iPad mini -->\n<link href=\"/assets/images/apple-touch-icon-114x114-precomposed.png\" rel=\"apple-touch-icon-precomposed\" sizes=\"114x114\"/><!-- 114x114 (precomposed) for iPhone 4, 4S, 5 and post-2011 iPod Touch -->\n<link href=\"/assets/images/apple-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png\" rel=\"apple-touch-icon-precomposed\" sizes=\"144x144\"/><!-- 144x144 (precomposed) for iPad 3rd and 4th generation -->\n<!-- Hide Searchbar if nojs -->\n<noscript>\n<style>\n      #searchbar { display:none; }\n  </style>\n</noscript>\n</meta></head>\n<body class=\"page\">\n<!--[if lt IE 9]><div class=\"browser-upgrade alert alert-info\">You are using an <strong>outdated</strong> browser.

Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac)\nor bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).\nThe first time you run version 0.15.0 or newer, your chainstate database will be converted to a\nnew format, which will take anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour,\ndepending on the speed of your machine.\nNote that the block database format also changed in version 0.8.0 and there is no\nautomatic upgrade code from before version 0.8 to version 0.15.0 or higher. Upgrading\ndirectly from 0.7.x and earlier without re-downloading the blockchain is not supported.\nHowever, as usual, old wallet versions are still supported.\nDowngrading warning\nWallets created in 0.16 and later are not compatible with versions prior to 0.16\nand will not work if you try to use newly created wallets in older versions. Existing\nwallets that were created with older versions are not affected by this.\nCompatibility\nBitcoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using\nthe Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later. Windows XP is not supported.\nBitcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not\nfrequently tested on them.\nNotable changes\nMiner block size removed\nThe -blockmaxsize option for miners to limit their blocks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sizes was\ndeprecated in version 0.15.1, and has now been removed. Miners should use the\n-blockmaxweight option if they want to limit the weight of their blocks\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nweights.\n0.16.1 change log\nPolicy\n\n#11423 d353dd1 [Policy] Several transaction standardness rules (jl2012)\n\nMining\n\n#12756 e802c22 [config] Remove blockmaxsize option (jnewbery)\n\nBlock and transaction handling\n\n#13199 c71e535 Bugfix: ensure consistency of m_failed_blocks after reconsiderblock (sdaftuar)\n#13023 bb79aaf Fix some concurrency issues in ActivateBestChain() (skeees)\n\nP2P protocol and network code\n\n#12626 f60e84d Limit the number of IPs addrman learns from each DNS seeder (EthanHeilman)\n\nWallet\n\n#13265 5d8de76 Exit SyncMetaData if there are no transactions to sync (laanwj)\n#13030 5ff571e Fix zapwallettxes/multiwallet interaction.

Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt</code> (on Mac)\nor <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoind</code>/<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin-qt</code> (on Linux).</p>\n<p>The first time you run version 0.15.0 or newer, your chainstate database will be converted to a\nnew format, which will take anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour,\ndepending on the speed of your machine.</p>\n<p>Note that the block database format also changed in version 0.8.0 and there is no\nautomatic upgrade code from before version 0.8 to version 0.15.0 or higher. Upgrading\ndirectly from 0.7.x and earlier without re-downloading the blockchain is not supported.\nHowever, as usual, old wallet versions are still supported.</p>\n<h2 id=\"downgrading-warning\">Downgrading warning</h2>\n<p>Wallets created in 0.16 and later are not compatible with versions prior to 0.16\nand will not work if you try to use newly created wallets in older versions. Existing\nwallets that were created with older versions are not affected by this.</p>\n<h1 id=\"compatibility\">Compatibility</h1>\n<p>Bitcoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using\nthe Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later. Windows XP is not supported.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not\nfrequently tested on them.</p>\n<h1 id=\"notable-changes\">Notable changes</h1>\n<h2 id=\"miner-block-size-removed\">Miner block size removed</h2>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-blockmaxsize</code> option for miners to limit their blocks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sizes was\ndeprecated in version 0.15.1, and has now been removed.

Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac)\nor bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).\nThe first time you run version 0.15.0 or newer, your chainstate database will be converted to a\nnew format, which will take anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour,\ndepending on the speed of your machine.\nNote that the block database format also changed in version 0.8.0 and there is no\nautomatic upgrade code from before version 0.8 to version 0.15.0 or higher. Upgrading\ndirectly from 0.7.x and earlier without re-downloading the blockchain is not supported.\nHowever, as usual, old wallet versions are still supported.\nDowngrading warning\nWallets created in 0.16 and later are not compatible with versions prior to 0.16\nand will not work if you try to use newly created wallets in older versions. Existing\nwallets that were created with older versions are not affected by this.\nCompatibility\nBitcoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using\nthe Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later. Windows XP is not supported.\nBitcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not\nfrequently tested on them.\nNotable changes\nWallet changes\nSegwit Wallet\nBitcoin Core 0.16.0 introduces full support for segwit in the wallet and user interfaces. A new -addresstype argument has been added, which supports legacy, p2sh-segwit (default), and bech32 addresses. It controls what kind of addresses are produced by getnewaddress, getaccountaddress, and createmultisigaddress. A -changetype argument has also been added, with the same options, and by default equal to -addresstype, to control which kind of change is used.\nA new address_type parameter has been added to the getnewaddress and addmultisigaddress RPCs to specify which type of address to generate.\nA change_type argument has been added to the fundrawtransaction RPC to override the -changetype argument for specific transactions.\n\nAll segwit addresses created through getnewaddress or *multisig RPCs explicitly get their redeemscripts added to the wallet file. This means that downgrading after creating a segwit address will work, as long as the wallet file is up to date.\nAll segwit keys in the wallet get an implicit redeemscript added, without it being written to the file. This means recovery of an old backup will work, as long as you use new software.\nAll keypool keys that are seen used in transactions explicitly get their redeemscripts added to the wallet files. This means that downgrading after recovering from a backup that includes a segwit address will work\n\nNote that some RPCs do not yet support segwit addresses. Notably, signmessage/verifymessage doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t support segwit addresses, nor does importmulti at this time. Support for segwit in those RPCs will continue to be added in future versions.\nP2WPKH change outputs are now used by default if any destination in the transaction is a P2WPKH or P2WSH output. This is done to ensure the change output is as indistinguishable from the other outputs as possible in either case.\nBIP173 (Bech32) Address support (\u00e2\u0080\u009cbc1\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d addresses)\nFull support for native segwit addresses (BIP173 / Bech32) has now been added.\nThis includes the ability to send to BIP173 addresses (including non-v0 ones), and generating these\naddresses (including as default new addresses, see above).\nA checkbox has been added to the GUI to select whether a Bech32 address or P2SH-wrapped address should be generated when using segwit addresses. When launched with -addresstype=bech32 it is checked by default. When launched with -addresstype=legacy it is unchecked and disabled.\nHD-wallets by default\nDue to a backward-incompatible change in the wallet database, wallets created\nwith version 0.16.0 will be rejected by previous versions. Also, version 0.16.0\nwill only create hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets. Note that this only applies\nto new wallets; wallets made with previous versions will not be upgraded to be HD.\nReplace-By-Fee by default in GUI\nThe send screen now uses BIP125 RBF by default, regardless of -walletrbf.\nThere is a checkbox to mark the transaction as final.\nThe RPC default remains unchanged: to use RBF, launch with -walletrbf=1 or\nuse the replaceable argument for individual transactions.\nWallets directory configuration (-walletdir)\nBitcoin Core now has more flexibility in where the wallets directory can be\nlocated. Previously wallet database files were stored at the top level of the\nbitcoin data directory. The behavior is now:\n\nFor new installations (where the data directory doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t already exist),\nwallets will now be stored in a new wallets/ subdirectory inside the data\ndirectory by default.\nFor existing nodes (where the data directory already exists), wallets will be\nstored in the data directory root by default. If a wallets/ subdirectory\nalready exists in the data directory root, then wallets will be stored in the\nwallets/ subdirectory by default.\nThe location of the wallets directory can be overridden by specifying a\n-walletdir=<path> option where <path> can be an absolute path to a\ndirectory or directory symlink.\n\nCare should be taken when choosing the wallets directory location, as if it\nbecomes unavailable during operation, funds may be lost.\nBuild: Minimum GCC bumped to 4.8.x\nThe minimum version of the GCC compiler required to compile Bitcoin Core is now 4.8. No effort will be\nmade to support older versions of GCC. See discussion in issue #11732 for more information.\nThe minimum version for the Clang compiler is still 3.3. Other minimum dependency versions can be found in doc/dependencies.md in the repository.\nSupport for signalling pruned nodes (BIP159)\nPruned nodes can now signal BIP159\u00e2\u0080\u0099s NODE_NETWORK_LIMITED using service bits, in preparation for\nfull BIP159 support in later versions. This would allow pruned nodes to serve the most recent blocks. However, the current change does not yet include support for connecting to these pruned peers.\nPerformance: SHA256 assembly enabled by default\nThe SHA256 hashing optimizations for architectures supporting SSE4, which lead to ~50% speedups in SHA256 on supported hardware (~5% faster synchronization and block validation), have now been enabled by default. In previous versions they were enabled using the --enable-experimental-asm flag when building, but are now the default and no longer deemed experimental.\nGUI changes\n\nUses of \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00c2\u00b5BTC\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the GUI now also show the more colloquial term \u00e2\u0080\u009cbits\u00e2\u0080\u009d, specified in BIP176.\nThe option to reuse a previous address has now been removed. This was justified by the need to \u00e2\u0080\u009cresend\u00e2\u0080\u009d an invoice, but now that we have the request history, that need should be gone.\nSupport for searching by TXID has been added, rather than just address and label.\nA \u00e2\u0080\u009cUse available balance\u00e2\u0080\u009d option has been added to the send coins dialog, to add the remaining available wallet balance to a transaction output.\nA toggle for unblinding the password fields on the password dialog has been added.\n\nRPC changes\nNew rescanblockchain RPC\nA new RPC rescanblockchain has been added to manually invoke a blockchain rescan.\nThe RPC supports start and end-height arguments for the rescan, and can be used in a\nmultiwallet environment to rescan the blockchain at runtime.\nNew savemempool RPC\nA new savemempool RPC has been added which allows the current mempool to be saved to\ndisk at any time to avoid it being lost due to crashes / power loss.\nSafe mode disabled by default\nSafe mode is now disabled by default and must be manually enabled (with -disablesafemode=0) if you wish to use it. Safe mode is a feature that disables a subset of RPC calls - mostly related to the wallet and sending - automatically in case certain problem conditions with the network are detected. However, developers have come to regard these checks as not reliable enough to act on automatically. Even with safe mode disabled, they will still cause warnings in the warnings field of the getneworkinfo RPC and launch the -alertnotify command.\nRenamed script for creating JSON-RPC credentials\nThe share/rpcuser/rpcuser.py script was renamed to share/rpcauth/rpcauth.py. This script can be\nused to create rpcauth credentials for a JSON-RPC user.\nValidateaddress improvements\nThe validateaddress RPC output has been extended with a few new fields, and support for segwit addresses (both P2SH and Bech32). Specifically:\n\nA new field iswitness is True for P2WPKH and P2WSH addresses (\u00e2\u0080\u009cbc1\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d addresses), but not for P2SH-wrapped segwit addresses (see below).\nThe existing field isscript will now also report True for P2WSH addresses.\nA new field embedded is present for all script addresses where the script is known and matches something that can be interpreted as a known address. This is particularly true for P2SH-P2WPKH and P2SH-P2WSH addresses. The value for embedded includes much of the information validateaddress would report if invoked directly on the embedded address.\nFor multisig scripts a new pubkeys field was added that reports the full public keys involved in the script (if known). This is a replacement for the existing addresses field (which reports the same information but encoded as P2PKH addresses), represented in a more useful and less confusing way. The addresses field remains present for non-segwit addresses for backward compatibility.\nFor all single-key addresses with known key (even when wrapped in P2SH or P2WSH), the pubkey field will be present. In particular, this means that invoking validateaddress on the output of getnewaddress will always report the pubkey, even when the address type is P2SH-P2WPKH.\n\nLow-level changes\n\nThe deprecated RPC getinfo was removed. It is recommended that the more specific RPCs are used:\n    \ngetblockchaininfo\ngetnetworkinfo\ngetwalletinfo\ngetmininginfo\n\n\nThe wallet RPC getreceivedbyaddress will return an error if called with an address not in the wallet.\nThe wallet RPC addwitnessaddress was deprecated and will be removed in version 0.17,\nset the address_type argument of getnewaddress, or option -addresstype=[bech32|p2sh-segwit] instead.\ndumpwallet now includes hex-encoded scripts from the wallet in the dumpfile, and\nimportwallet now imports these scripts, but corresponding addresses may not be added\ncorrectly or a manual rescan may be required to find relevant transactions.\nThe RPC getblockchaininfo now includes an errors field.\nA new blockhash parameter has been added to the getrawtransaction RPC which allows for a raw transaction to be fetched from a specific block if known, even without -txindex enabled.\nThe decoderawtransaction and fundrawtransaction RPCs now have optional iswitness parameters to override the\nheuristic witness checks if necessary.\nThe walletpassphrase timeout is now clamped to 2^30 seconds.\nUsing addresses with the createmultisig RPC is now deprecated, and will be removed in a later version. Public keys should be used instead.\nBlockchain rescans now no longer lock the wallet for the entire rescan process, so other RPCs can now be used at the same time (although results of balances / transactions may be incorrect or incomplete until the rescan is complete).\nThe logging RPC has now been made public rather than hidden.\nAn initialblockdownload boolean has been added to the getblockchaininfo RPC to indicate whether the node is currently in IBD or not.\nminrelaytxfee is now included in the output of getmempoolinfo\n\nOther changed command-line options\n\n-debuglogfile=<file> can be used to specify an alternative debug logging file.\nbitcoin-cli now has an -stdinrpcpass option to allow the RPC password to be read from standard input.\nThe -usehd option has been removed.\nbitcoin-cli now supports a new -getinfo flag which returns an output like that of the now-removed getinfo RPC.\n\nTesting changes\n\nThe default regtest JSON-RPC port has been changed to 18443 to avoid conflict with testnet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s default of 18332.\nSegwit is now always active in regtest mode by default. Thus, if you upgrade a regtest node you will need to either -reindex or use the old rules by adding vbparams=segwit:0:999999999999 to your regtest bitcoin.conf. Failure to do this will result in a CheckBlockIndex() assertion failure that will look like: Assertion `(pindexFirstNeverProcessed != nullptr) == (pindex->nChainTx == 0)\u00e2\u0080\u0099

Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt</code> (on Mac)\nor <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoind</code>/<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin-qt</code> (on Linux).</p>\n<p>The first time you run version 0.15.0 or newer, your chainstate database will be converted to a\nnew format, which will take anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour,\ndepending on the speed of your machine.</p>\n<p>Note that the block database format also changed in version 0.8.0 and there is no\nautomatic upgrade code from before version 0.8 to version 0.15.0 or higher. Upgrading\ndirectly from 0.7.x and earlier without re-downloading the blockchain is not supported.\nHowever, as usual, old wallet versions are still supported.</p>\n<h2 id=\"downgrading-warning\">Downgrading warning</h2>\n<p>Wallets created in 0.16 and later are not compatible with versions prior to 0.16\nand will not work if you try to use newly created wallets in older versions. Existing\nwallets that were created with older versions are not affected by this.</p>\n<h1 id=\"compatibility\">Compatibility</h1>\n<p>Bitcoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using\nthe Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later. Windows XP is not supported.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not\nfrequently tested on them.</p>\n<h1 id=\"notable-changes\">Notable changes</h1>\n<h2 id=\"wallet-changes\">Wallet changes</h2>\n<h3 id=\"segwit-wallet\">Segwit Wallet</h3>\n<p>Bitcoin Core 0.16.0 introduces full support for segwit in the wallet and user interfaces. A new <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-addresstype</code> argument has been added, which supports <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">legacy</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">p2sh-segwit</code> (default), and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bech32</code> addresses. It controls what kind of addresses are produced by <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getnewaddress</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getaccountaddress</code>, and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">createmultisigaddress</code>. A <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-changetype</code> argument has also been added, with the same options, and by default equal to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-addresstype</code>, to control which kind of change is used.</p>\n<p>A new <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">address_type</code> parameter has been added to the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getnewaddress</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">addmultisigaddress</code> RPCs to specify which type of address to generate.\nA <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">change_type</code> argument has been added to the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">fundrawtransaction</code> RPC to override the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-changetype</code> argument for specific transactions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All segwit addresses created through <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getnewaddress</code> or <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">*multisig</code> RPCs explicitly get their redeemscripts added to the wallet file. This means that downgrading after creating a segwit address will work, as long as the wallet file is up to date.</li>\n<li>All segwit keys in the wallet get an implicit redeemscript added, without it being written to the file. This means recovery of an old backup will work, as long as you use new software.</li>\n<li>All keypool keys that are seen used in transactions explicitly get their redeemscripts added to the wallet files. This means that downgrading after recovering from a backup that includes a segwit address will work</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that some RPCs do not yet support segwit addresses. Notably, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">signmessage</code>/<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">verifymessage</code> doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t support segwit addresses, nor does <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">importmulti</code> at this time. Support for segwit in those RPCs will continue to be added in future versions.</p>\n<p>P2WPKH change outputs are now used by default if any destination in the transaction is a P2WPKH or P2WSH output. This is done to ensure the change output is as indistinguishable from the other outputs as possible in either case.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bip173-bech32-address-support-bc1-addresses\">BIP173 (Bech32) Address support (\u00e2\u0080\u009cbc1\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d addresses)</h3>\n<p>Full support for native segwit addresses (BIP173 / Bech32) has now been added.\nThis includes the ability to send to BIP173 addresses (including non-v0 ones), and generating these\naddresses (including as default new addresses, see above).</p>\n<p>A checkbox has been added to the GUI to select whether a Bech32 address or P2SH-wrapped address should be generated when using segwit addresses. When launched with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-addresstype=bech32</code> it is checked by default. When launched with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-addresstype=legacy</code> it is unchecked and disabled.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hd-wallets-by-default\">HD-wallets by default</h3>\n<p>Due to a backward-incompatible change in the wallet database, wallets created\nwith version 0.16.0 will be rejected by previous versions. Also, version 0.16.0\nwill only create hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets. Note that this only applies\nto new wallets; wallets made with previous versions will not be upgraded to be HD.</p>\n<h3 id=\"replace-by-fee-by-default-in-gui\">Replace-By-Fee by default in GUI</h3>\n<p>The send screen now uses BIP125 RBF by default, regardless of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-walletrbf</code>.\nThere is a checkbox to mark the transaction as final.</p>\n<p>The RPC default remains unchanged: to use RBF, launch with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-walletrbf=1</code> or\nuse the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">replaceable</code> argument for individual transactions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"wallets-directory-configuration--walletdir\">Wallets directory configuration (<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-walletdir</code>)</h3>\n<p>Bitcoin Core now has more flexibility in where the wallets directory can be\nlocated. Previously wallet database files were stored at the top level of the\nbitcoin data directory. The behavior is now:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For new installations (where the data directory doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t already exist),\nwallets will now be stored in a new <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">wallets/</code> subdirectory inside the data\ndirectory by default.</li>\n<li>For existing nodes (where the data directory already exists), wallets will be\nstored in the data directory root by default. If a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">wallets/</code> subdirectory\nalready exists in the data directory root, then wallets will be stored in the\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">wallets/</code> subdirectory by default.</li>\n<li>The location of the wallets directory can be overridden by specifying a\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-walletdir=&lt;path&gt;</code> option where <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">&lt;path&gt;</code> can be an absolute path to a\ndirectory or directory symlink.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Care should be taken when choosing the wallets directory location, as if it\nbecomes unavailable during operation, funds may be lost.</p>\n<h2 id=\"build-minimum-gcc-bumped-to-48x\">Build: Minimum GCC bumped to 4.8.x</h2>\n<p>The minimum version of the GCC compiler required to compile Bitcoin Core is now 4.8. No effort will be\nmade to support older versions of GCC. See discussion in issue <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11732\">#11732</a> for more information.\nThe minimum version for the Clang compiler is still 3.3. Other minimum dependency versions can be found in <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">doc/dependencies.md</code> in the repository.</p>\n<h2 id=\"support-for-signalling-pruned-nodes-bip159\">Support for signalling pruned nodes (BIP159)</h2>\n<p>Pruned nodes can now signal BIP159\u00e2\u0080\u0099s NODE_NETWORK_LIMITED using service bits, in preparation for\nfull BIP159 support in later versions. This would allow pruned nodes to serve the most recent blocks. However, the current change does not yet include support for connecting to these pruned peers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"performance-sha256-assembly-enabled-by-default\">Performance: SHA256 assembly enabled by default</h2>\n<p>The SHA256 hashing optimizations for architectures supporting SSE4, which lead to ~50% speedups in SHA256 on supported hardware (~5% faster synchronization and block validation), have now been enabled by default. In previous versions they were enabled using the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">--enable-experimental-asm</code> flag when building, but are now the default and no longer deemed experimental.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gui-changes\">GUI changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Uses of \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00c2\u00b5BTC\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the GUI now also show the more colloquial term \u00e2\u0080\u009cbits\u00e2\u0080\u009d, specified in BIP176.</li>\n<li>The option to reuse a previous address has now been removed. This was justified by the need to \u00e2\u0080\u009cresend\u00e2\u0080\u009d an invoice, but now that we have the request history, that need should be gone.</li>\n<li>Support for searching by TXID has been added, rather than just address and label.</li>\n<li>A \u00e2\u0080\u009cUse available balance\u00e2\u0080\u009d option has been added to the send coins dialog, to add the remaining available wallet balance to a transaction output.</li>\n<li>A toggle for unblinding the password fields on the password dialog has been added.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"rpc-changes\">RPC changes</h2>\n<h3 id=\"new-rescanblockchain-rpc\">New <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">rescanblockchain</code> RPC</h3>\n<p>A new RPC <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">rescanblockchain</code> has been added to manually invoke a blockchain rescan.\nThe RPC supports start and end-height arguments for the rescan, and can be used in a\nmultiwallet environment to rescan the blockchain at runtime.</p>\n<h3 id=\"new-savemempool-rpc\">New <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">savemempool</code> RPC</h3>\n<p>A new <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">savemempool</code> RPC has been added which allows the current mempool to be saved to\ndisk at any time to avoid it being lost due to crashes / power loss.</p>\n<h3 id=\"safe-mode-disabled-by-default\">Safe mode disabled by default</h3>\n<p>Safe mode is now disabled by default and must be manually enabled (with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-disablesafemode=0</code>) if you wish to use it. Safe mode is a feature that disables a subset of RPC calls - mostly related to the wallet and sending - automatically in case certain problem conditions with the network are detected. However, developers have come to regard these checks as not reliable enough to act on automatically. Even with safe mode disabled, they will still cause warnings in the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">warnings</code> field of the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getneworkinfo</code> RPC and launch the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-alertnotify</code> command.</p>\n<h3 id=\"renamed-script-for-creating-json-rpc-credentials\">Renamed script for creating JSON-RPC credentials</h3>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">share/rpcuser/rpcuser.py</code> script was renamed to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">share/rpcauth/rpcauth.py</code>. This script can be\nused to create <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">rpcauth</code> credentials for a JSON-RPC user.</p>\n<h3 id=\"validateaddress-improvements\">Validateaddress improvements</h3>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">validateaddress</code> RPC output has been extended with a few new fields, and support for segwit addresses (both P2SH and Bech32). Specifically:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A new field <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">iswitness</code> is True for P2WPKH and P2WSH addresses (\u00e2\u0080\u009cbc1\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d addresses), but not for P2SH-wrapped segwit addresses (see below).</li>\n<li>The existing field <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">isscript</code> will now also report True for P2WSH addresses.</li>\n<li>A new field <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">embedded</code> is present for all script addresses where the script is known and matches something that can be interpreted as a known address. This is particularly true for P2SH-P2WPKH and P2SH-P2WSH addresses. The value for <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">embedded</code> includes much of the information <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">validateaddress</code> would report if invoked directly on the embedded address.</li>\n<li>For multisig scripts a new <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">pubkeys</code> field was added that reports the full public keys involved in the script (if known). This is a replacement for the existing <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">addresses</code> field (which reports the same information but encoded as P2PKH addresses), represented in a more useful and less confusing way. The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">addresses</code> field remains present for non-segwit addresses for backward compatibility.</li>\n<li>For all single-key addresses with known key (even when wrapped in P2SH or P2WSH), the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">pubkey</code> field will be present. In particular, this means that invoking <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">validateaddress</code> on the output of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getnewaddress</code> will always report the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">pubkey</code>, even when the address type is P2SH-P2WPKH.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"low-level-changes\">Low-level changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The deprecated RPC <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getinfo</code> was removed. It is recommended that the more specific RPCs are used:\n    <ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getblockchaininfo</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getnetworkinfo</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getwalletinfo</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getmininginfo</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The wallet RPC <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getreceivedbyaddress</code> will return an error if called with an address not in the wallet.</li>\n<li>The wallet RPC <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">addwitnessaddress</code> was deprecated and will be removed in version 0.17,\nset the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">address_type</code> argument of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getnewaddress</code>, or option <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-addresstype=[bech32|p2sh-segwit]</code> instead.</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">dumpwallet</code> now includes hex-encoded scripts from the wallet in the dumpfile, and\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">importwallet</code> now imports these scripts, but corresponding addresses may not be added\ncorrectly or a manual rescan may be required to find relevant transactions.</li>\n<li>The RPC <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getblockchaininfo</code> now includes an <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">errors</code> field.</li>\n<li>A new <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">blockhash</code> parameter has been added to the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getrawtransaction</code> RPC which allows for a raw transaction to be fetched from a specific block if known, even without <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-txindex</code> enabled.</li>\n<li>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">decoderawtransaction</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">fundrawtransaction</code> RPCs now have optional <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">iswitness</code> parameters to override the\nheuristic witness checks if necessary.</li>\n<li>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">walletpassphrase</code> timeout is now clamped to 2^30 seconds.</li>\n<li>Using addresses with the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">createmultisig</code> RPC is now deprecated, and will be removed in a later version. Public keys should be used instead.</li>\n<li>Blockchain rescans now no longer lock the wallet for the entire rescan process, so other RPCs can now be used at the same time (although results of balances / transactions may be incorrect or incomplete until the rescan is complete).</li>\n<li>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">logging</code> RPC has now been made public rather than hidden.</li>\n<li>An <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">initialblockdownload</code> boolean has been added to the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getblockchaininfo</code> RPC to indicate whether the node is currently in IBD or not.</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">minrelaytxfee</code> is now included in the output of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getmempoolinfo</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"other-changed-command-line-options\">Other changed command-line options</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-debuglogfile=&lt;file&gt;</code> can be used to specify an alternative debug logging file.</li>\n<li>bitcoin-cli now has an <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-stdinrpcpass</code> option to allow the RPC password to be read from standard input.</li>\n<li>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-usehd</code> option has been removed.</li>\n<li>bitcoin-cli now supports a new <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-getinfo</code> flag which returns an output like that of the now-removed <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getinfo</code> RPC.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"testing-changes\">Testing changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The default regtest JSON-RPC port has been changed to 18443 to avoid conflict with testnet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s default of 18332.</li>\n<li>Segwit is now always active in regtest mode by default. Thus, if you upgrade a regtest node you will need to either -reindex or use the old rules by adding <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">vbparams=segwit:0:999999999999</code> to your regtest bitcoin.conf. Failure to do this will result in a CheckBlockIndex() assertion failure that will look like: Assertion `(pindexFirstNeverProcessed != nullptr) == (pindex-&gt;nChainTx == 0)\u00e2\u0080\u0099

Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the \ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac)\nor bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).\nThe first time you run version 0.15.0 or higher, your chainstate database will\nbe converted to a new format, which will take anywhere from a few minutes to\nhalf an hour, depending on the speed of your machine.\nThe file format of fee_estimates.dat changed in version 0.15.0. Hence, a\ndowngrade from version 0.15 or upgrade to version 0.15 will cause all fee\nestimates to be discarded.\nNote that the block database format also changed in version 0.8.0 and there is no\nautomatic upgrade code from before version 0.8 to version 0.15.0. Upgrading\ndirectly from 0.7.x and earlier without redownloading the blockchain is not supported.\nHowever, as usual, old wallet versions are still supported.\nDowngrading warning\nThe chainstate database for this release is not compatible with previous\nreleases, so if you run 0.15 and then decide to switch back to any\nolder version, you will need to run the old release with the -reindex-chainstate\noption to rebuild the chainstate data structures in the old format.\nIf your node has pruning enabled, this will entail re-downloading and\nprocessing the entire blockchain.\nCompatibility\nBitcoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using\nthe Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later. Windows XP is not supported.\nBitcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not\nfrequently tested on them.\nNotable changes\nDenial-of-Service vulnerability CVE-2018-17144\nA denial-of-service vulnerability exploitable by miners has been discovered in\nBitcoin Core versions 0.14.0 up to 0.16.2. It is recommended to upgrade any of\nthe vulnerable versions to 0.15.2 or 0.16.3 as soon as possible.\n0.15.2 Change log\nBuild system\n\n#11995 9bb1a16 depends: Fix Qt build with XCode

Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the \ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac)\nor bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).\nThe first time you run version 0.15.0 or higher, your chainstate database will\nbe converted to a new format, which will take anywhere from a few minutes to\nhalf an hour, depending on the speed of your machine.\nThe file format of fee_estimates.dat changed in version 0.15.0. Hence, a\ndowngrade from version 0.15 or upgrade to version 0.15 will cause all fee\nestimates to be discarded.\nNote that the block database format also changed in version 0.8.0 and there is no\nautomatic upgrade code from before version 0.8 to version 0.15.0. Upgrading\ndirectly from 0.7.x and earlier without redownloading the blockchain is not supported.\nHowever, as usual, old wallet versions are still supported.\nDowngrading warning\nThe chainstate database for this release is not compatible with previous\nreleases, so if you run 0.15 and then decide to switch back to any\nolder version, you will need to run the old release with the -reindex-chainstate\noption to rebuild the chainstate data structures in the old format.\nIf your node has pruning enabled, this will entail re-downloading and\nprocessing the entire blockchain.\nCompatibility\nBitcoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using\nthe Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later. Windows XP is not supported.\nBitcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not\nfrequently tested on them.\nNotable changes\nNetwork fork safety enhancements\nA number of changes to the way Bitcoin Core deals with peer connections and invalid blocks\nhave been made, as a safety precaution against blockchain forks and misbehaving peers.\n\n\nUnrequested blocks with less work than the minimum-chain-work are now no longer processed even\nif they have more work than the tip (a potential issue during IBD where the tip may have low-work).\nThis prevents peers wasting the resources of a node.\n\n\nPeers which provide a chain with less work than the minimum-chain-work during IBD will now be disconnected.\n\n\nFor a given outbound peer, we now check whether their best known block has at least as much work as our tip. If it\ndoesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, and if we still haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t heard about a block with sufficient work after a 20 minute timeout, then we send\na single getheaders message, and wait 2 more minutes. If after two minutes their best known block has insufficient\nwork, we disconnect that peer. We protect 4 of our outbound peers from being disconnected by this logic to prevent\nexcessive network topology changes as a result of this algorithm, while still ensuring that we have a reasonable\nnumber of nodes not known to be on bogus chains.\n\n\nOutbound (non-manual) peers that serve us block headers that are already known to be invalid (other than compact\nblock announcements, because BIP 152 explicitly permits nodes to relay compact blocks before fully validating them)\nwill now be disconnected.\n\n\nIf the chain tip has not been advanced for over 30 minutes, we now assume the tip may be stale and will try to connect\nto an additional outbound peer. A periodic check ensures that if this extra peer connection is in use, we will disconnect\nthe peer that least recently announced a new block.\n\n\nThe set of all known invalid-themselves blocks (i.e. blocks which we attempted to connect but which were found to be\ninvalid) are now tracked and used to check if new headers build on an invalid chain. This ensures that everything that\ndescends from an invalid block is marked as such.\n\n\nMiner block size limiting deprecated\nThough blockmaxweight has been preferred for limiting the size of blocks returned by\ngetblocktemplate since 0.13.0, blockmaxsize remained as an option for those who wished\nto limit their block size directly. Using this option resulted in a few UI issues as\nwell as non-optimal fee selection and ever-so-slightly worse performance, and has thus\nnow been deprecated. Further, the blockmaxsize option is now used only to calculate an\nimplied blockmaxweight, instead of limiting block size directly. Any miners who wish\nto limit their blocks by size, instead of by weight, will have to do so manually by\nremoving transactions from their block template directly.\nGUI settings backed up on reset\nThe GUI settings will now be written to guisettings.ini.bak in the data directory before wiping them when\nthe -resetguisettings argument is used. This can be used to retroactively troubleshoot issues due to the\nGUI settings.\nDuplicate wallets disallowed\nPreviously, it was possible to open the same wallet twice by manually copying the wallet file, causing\nissues when both were opened simultaneously. It is no longer possible to open copies of the same wallet.\nDebug -minimumchainwork argument added\nA hidden debug argument -minimumchainwork has been added to allow a custom minimum work value to be used\nwhen validating a chain.\nLow-level RPC changes\n\n\nThe \u00e2\u0080\u009ccurrentblocksize\u00e2\u0080\u009d value in getmininginfo has been removed.\n\n\ndumpwallet no longer allows overwriting files. This is a security measure\nas well as prevents dangerous user mistakes.\n\n\nbackupwallet will now fail when attempting to backup to source file, rather than\ndestroying the wallet.\n\n\nlistsinceblock will now throw an error if an unknown blockhash argument\nvalue is passed, instead of returning a list of all wallet transactions since\nthe genesis block. The behaviour is unchanged when an empty string is provided.\n\n\n0.15.1 Change log\nMining\n\n#11100 7871a7d Fix confusing blockmax{size,weight} options, dont default to throwing away money

Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the \ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt</code> (on Mac)\nor <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoind</code>/<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin-qt</code> (on Linux).</p>\n<p>The first time you run version 0.15.0 or higher, your chainstate database will\nbe converted to a new format, which will take anywhere from a few minutes to\nhalf an hour, depending on the speed of your machine.</p>\n<p>The file format of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">fee_estimates.dat</code> changed in version 0.15.0. Hence, a\ndowngrade from version 0.15 or upgrade to version 0.15 will cause all fee\nestimates to be discarded.</p>\n<p>Note that the block database format also changed in version 0.8.0 and there is no\nautomatic upgrade code from before version 0.8 to version 0.15.0. Upgrading\ndirectly from 0.7.x and earlier without redownloading the blockchain is not supported.\nHowever, as usual, old wallet versions are still supported.</p>\n<h2 id=\"downgrading-warning\">Downgrading warning</h2>\n<p>The chainstate database for this release is not compatible with previous\nreleases, so if you run 0.15 and then decide to switch back to any\nolder version, you will need to run the old release with the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-reindex-chainstate</code>\noption to rebuild the chainstate data structures in the old format.</p>\n<p>If your node has pruning enabled, this will entail re-downloading and\nprocessing the entire blockchain.</p>\n<h1 id=\"compatibility\">Compatibility</h1>\n<p>Bitcoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using\nthe Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later. Windows XP is not supported.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not\nfrequently tested on them.</p>\n<h1 id=\"notable-changes\">Notable changes</h1>\n<h2 id=\"network-fork-safety-enhancements\">Network fork safety enhancements</h2>\n<p>A number of changes to the way Bitcoin Core deals with peer connections and invalid blocks\nhave been made, as a safety precaution against blockchain forks and misbehaving peers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Unrequested blocks with less work than the minimum-chain-work are now no longer processed even\nif they have more work than the tip (a potential issue during IBD where the tip may have low-work).\nThis prevents peers wasting the resources of a node.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Peers which provide a chain with less work than the minimum-chain-work during IBD will now be disconnected.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For a given outbound peer, we now check whether their best known block has at least as much work as our tip. If it\ndoesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, and if we still haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t heard about a block with sufficient work after a 20 minute timeout, then we send\na single getheaders message, and wait 2 more minutes. If after two minutes their best known block has insufficient\nwork, we disconnect that peer. We protect 4 of our outbound peers from being disconnected by this logic to prevent\nexcessive network topology changes as a result of this algorithm, while still ensuring that we have a reasonable\nnumber of nodes not known to be on bogus chains.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Outbound (non-manual) peers that serve us block headers that are already known to be invalid (other than compact\nblock announcements, because BIP 152 explicitly permits nodes to relay compact blocks before fully validating them)\nwill now be disconnected.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If the chain tip has not been advanced for over 30 minutes, we now assume the tip may be stale and will try to connect\nto an additional outbound peer. A periodic check ensures that if this extra peer connection is in use, we will disconnect\nthe peer that least recently announced a new block.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The set of all known invalid-themselves blocks (i.e. blocks which we attempted to connect but which were found to be\ninvalid) are now tracked and used to check if new headers build on an invalid chain. This ensures that everything that\ndescends from an invalid block is marked as such.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"miner-block-size-limiting-deprecated\">Miner block size limiting deprecated</h2>\n<p>Though blockmaxweight has been preferred for limiting the size of blocks returned by\ngetblocktemplate since 0.13.0, blockmaxsize remained as an option for those who wished\nto limit their block size directly. Using this option resulted in a few UI issues as\nwell as non-optimal fee selection and ever-so-slightly worse performance, and has thus\nnow been deprecated. Further, the blockmaxsize option is now used only to calculate an\nimplied blockmaxweight, instead of limiting block size directly. Any miners who wish\nto limit their blocks by size, instead of by weight, will have to do so manually by\nremoving transactions from their block template directly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gui-settings-backed-up-on-reset\">GUI settings backed up on reset</h2>\n<p>The GUI settings will now be written to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">guisettings.ini.bak</code> in the data directory before wiping them when\nthe <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-resetguisettings</code> argument is used. This can be used to retroactively troubleshoot issues due to the\nGUI settings.</p>\n<h2 id=\"duplicate-wallets-disallowed\">Duplicate wallets disallowed</h2>\n<p>Previously, it was possible to open the same wallet twice by manually copying the wallet file, causing\nissues when both were opened simultaneously. It is no longer possible to open copies of the same wallet.</p>\n<h2 id=\"debug--minimumchainwork-argument-added\">Debug <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-minimumchainwork</code> argument added</h2>\n<p>A hidden debug argument <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-minimumchainwork</code> has been added to allow a custom minimum work value to be used\nwhen validating a chain.</p>\n<h2 id=\"low-level-rpc-changes\">Low-level RPC changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The \u00e2\u0080\u009ccurrentblocksize\u00e2\u0080\u009d value in getmininginfo has been removed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">dumpwallet</code> no longer allows overwriting files. This is a security measure\nas well as prevents dangerous user mistakes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">backupwallet</code> will now fail when attempting to backup to source file, rather than\ndestroying the wallet.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">listsinceblock</code> will now throw an error if an unknown <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">blockhash</code> argument\nvalue is passed, instead of returning a list of all wallet transactions since\nthe genesis block.

Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the \ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac)\nor bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).\nThe first time you run version 0.15.0, your chainstate database will be converted to a\nnew format, which will take anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour,\ndepending on the speed of your machine.\nThe file format of fee_estimates.dat changed in version 0.15.0. Hence, a\ndowngrade from version 0.15.0 or upgrade to version 0.15.0 will cause all fee\nestimates to be discarded.\nNote that the block database format also changed in version 0.8.0 and there is no\nautomatic upgrade code from before version 0.8 to version 0.15.0. Upgrading\ndirectly from 0.7.x and earlier without redownloading the blockchain is not supported.\nHowever, as usual, old wallet versions are still supported.\nDowngrading warning\nThe chainstate database for this release is not compatible with previous\nreleases, so if you run 0.15 and then decide to switch back to any\nolder version, you will need to run the old release with the -reindex-chainstate\noption to rebuild the chainstate data structures in the old format.\nIf your node has pruning enabled, this will entail re-downloading and\nprocessing the entire blockchain.\nCompatibility\nBitcoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using\nthe Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later. Windows XP is not supported.\nBitcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not\nfrequently tested on them.\nNotes for 0.15.0\nCurrent SegWit support\nVersion 0.15.0 supports adding a segregated witness address via the addwitnessaddress RPC, but\nplease note that this is a testing/expert RPC, which does not guarantee recovery from backup. Only use\nthis RPC if you know what you are doing. More complete wallet support for segregated witness is coming\nin a next version.\nRescanning with encrypted wallets\nAs in previous versions, when using an encrypted HD wallet, the keypool cannot be topped up without unlocking\nthe wallet. This means that currently, in order to recover from a backup of an encrypted HD wallet, the user\nmust unlock the wallet with a really long timeout and manually trigger a rescan, otherwise they risk missing\nsome keys when auto-topup cannot run. Unfortunately there is no rescan RPC in this version, that will be\nincluded in a future version, so for now a rescan can be triggered using one of the import* commands, using\na dummy address generated by another (trusted) wallet.\nNotable changes\nPerformance Improvements\nVersion 0.15 contains a number of significant performance improvements, which make\nInitial Block Download, startup, transaction and block validation much faster:\n\nThe chainstate database (which is used for tracking UTXOs) has been changed\nfrom a per-transaction model to a per-output model (See PR 10195). Advantages of this model\nare that it:\n    \navoids the CPU overhead of deserializing and serializing the unused outputs;\nhas more predictable memory usage;\nuses simpler code;\nis adaptable to various future cache flushing strategies.\n\nAs a result, validating the blockchain during Initial Block Download (IBD) and reindex\nis ~30-40% faster, uses 10-20% less memory, and flushes to disk far less frequently.\nThe only downside is that the on-disk database is 15% larger. During the conversion from the previous format\na few extra gigabytes may be used.\n\nEarlier versions experienced a spike in memory usage while flushing UTXO updates to disk.\nAs a result, only half of the available memory was actually used as cache, and the other half was\nreserved to accommodate flushing. This is no longer the case (See PR 10148), and the entirety of\nthe available cache (see -dbcache) is now actually used as cache. This reduces the flushing\nfrequency by a factor 2 or more.\nIn previous versions, signature validation for transactions has been cached when the\ntransaction is accepted to the mempool. Version 0.15 extends this to cache the entire script\nvalidity (See PR 10192). This means that if a transaction in a block has already been accepted to the\nmempool, the scriptSig does not need to be re-evaluated. Empirical tests show that\nthis results in new block validation being 40-50% faster.\nLevelDB has been upgraded to version 1.20 (See PR 10544). This version contains hardware acceleration for CRC\non architectures supporting SSE 4.2. As a result, synchronization and block validation are now faster.\nSHA256 hashing has been optimized for architectures supporting SSE 4 (See PR 10821). SHA256 is around\n50% faster on supported hardware, which results in around 5% faster IBD and block\nvalidation. In version 0.15, SHA256 hardware optimization is disabled in release builds by\ndefault, but can be enabled by using --enable-experimental-asm when building.\nRefill of the keypool no longer flushes the wallet between each key which resulted in a ~20x speedup in creating a new wallet. Part of this speedup was used to increase the default keypool to 1000 keys to make recovery more robust. (See PR 10831).\n\nFee Estimation Improvements\nFee estimation has been significantly improved in version 0.15, with more accurate fee estimates used by the wallet and a wider range of options for advanced users of the estimatesmartfee and estimaterawfee RPCs (See PR 10199).\nChanges to internal logic and wallet behavior\n\nInternally, estimates are now tracked on 3 different time horizons. This allows for longer targets and means estimates adjust more quickly to changes in conditions.\nEstimates can now be conservative or economical. Conservative estimates use longer time horizons to produce an estimate which is less susceptible to rapid changes in fee conditions. Economical estimates use shorter time horizons and will be more affected by short-term changes in fee conditions. Economical estimates may be considerably lower during periods of low transaction activity (for example over weekends), but may result in transactions being unconfirmed if prevailing fees increase rapidly.\nBy default, the wallet will use conservative fee estimates to increase the reliability of transactions being confirmed within the desired target. For transactions that are marked as replaceable, the wallet will use an economical estimate by default, since the fee can be \u00e2\u0080\u0098bumped\u00e2\u0080\u0099 if the fee conditions change rapidly (See PR 10589).\nEstimates can now be made for confirmation targets up to 1008 blocks (one week).\nMore data on historical fee rates is stored, leading to more precise fee estimates.\nTransactions which leave the mempool due to eviction or other non-confirmed reasons are now taken into account by the fee estimation logic, leading to more accurate fee estimates.\nThe fee estimation logic will make sure enough data has been gathered to return a meaningful estimate. If there is insufficient data, a fallback default fee is used.\n\nChanges to fee estimate RPCs\n\nThe estimatefee RPC is now deprecated in favor of using only estimatesmartfee (which is the implementation used by the GUI)\nThe estimatesmartfee RPC interface has been changed (See PR 10707):\n    \nThe nblocks argument has been renamed to conf_target (to be consistent with other RPC methods).\nAn estimate_mode argument has been added. This argument takes one of the following strings: CONSERVATIVE, ECONOMICAL or UNSET (which defaults to CONSERVATIVE).\nThe RPC return object now contains an errors member, which returns errors encountered during processing.\nIf Bitcoin Core has not been running for long enough and has not seen enough blocks or transactions to produce an accurate fee estimation, an error will be returned (previously a value of -1 was used to indicate an error, which could be confused for a feerate).\n\n\nA new estimaterawfee RPC is added to provide raw fee data. External clients can query and use this data in their own fee estimation logic.\n\nMulti-wallet support\nBitcoin Core now supports loading multiple, separate wallets (See PR 8694, PR 10849). The wallets are completely separated, with individual balances, keys and received transactions.\nMulti-wallet is enabled by using more than one -wallet argument when starting Bitcoin, either on the command line or in the Bitcoin config file.\nIn Bitcoin-Qt, only the first wallet will be displayed and accessible for creating and signing transactions. GUI selectable multiple wallets will be supported in a future version. However, even in 0.15 other loaded wallets will remain synchronized to the node\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current tip in the background. This can be useful if running a pruned node, since loading a wallet where the most recent sync is beyond the pruned height results in having to download and revalidate the whole blockchain. Continuing to synchronize all wallets in the background avoids this problem.\nBitcoin Core 0.15.0 contains the following changes to the RPC interface and bitcoin-cli for multi-wallet:\n\nWhen running Bitcoin Core with a single wallet, there are no changes to the RPC interface or bitcoin-cli. All RPC calls and bitcoin-cli commands continue to work as before.\nWhen running Bitcoin Core with multi-wallet, all node-level RPC methods continue to work as before. HTTP RPC requests should be send to the normal <RPC IP address>:<RPC port> endpoint, and bitcoin-cli commands should be run as before. A node-level RPC method is any method which does not require access to the wallet.\nWhen running Bitcoin Core with multi-wallet, wallet-level RPC methods must specify the wallet for which they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re intended in every request. HTTP RPC requests should be send to the <RPC IP address>:<RPC port>/wallet/<wallet name> endpoint, for example 127.0.0.1:8332/wallet/wallet1.dat. bitcoin-cli commands should be run with a -rpcwallet option, for example bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=wallet1.dat getbalance.\nA new node-level listwallets RPC method is added to display which wallets are currently loaded. The names returned by this method are the same as those used in the HTTP endpoint and for the rpcwallet argument.\n\nNote that while multi-wallet is now fully supported, the RPC multi-wallet interface should be considered unstable for version 0.15.0, and there may backwards-incompatible changes in future versions.\nReplace-by-fee control in the GUI\nBitcoin Core has supported creating opt-in replace-by-fee (RBF) transactions\nsince version 0.12.0, and since version 0.14.0 has included a bumpfee RPC method to\nreplace unconfirmed opt-in RBF transactions with a new transaction that pays\na higher fee.\nIn version 0.15, creating an opt-in RBF transaction and replacing the unconfirmed\ntransaction with a higher-fee transaction are both supported in the GUI (See PR 9592).\nRemoval of Coin Age Priority\nIn previous versions of Bitcoin Core, a portion of each block could be reserved for transactions based on the age and value of UTXOs they spent. This concept (Coin Age Priority) is a policy choice by miners, and there are no consensus rules around the inclusion of Coin Age Priority transactions in blocks. In practice, only a few miners continue to use Coin Age Priority for transaction selection in blocks. Bitcoin Core 0.15 removes all remaining support for Coin Age Priority (See PR 9602). This has the following implications:\n\nThe concept of free transactions has been removed. High Coin Age Priority transactions would previously be allowed to be relayed even if they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t attach a miner fee. This is no longer possible since there is no concept of Coin Age Priority. The -limitfreerelay and -relaypriority options which controlled relay of free transactions have therefore been removed.\nThe -sendfreetransactions option has been removed, since almost all miners do not include transactions which do not attach a transaction fee.\nThe -blockprioritysize option has been removed.\nThe estimatepriority and estimatesmartpriority RPCs have been removed.\nThe getmempoolancestors, getmempooldescendants, getmempoolentry and getrawmempool RPCs no longer return startingpriority and currentpriority.\nThe prioritisetransaction RPC no longer takes a priority_delta argument, which is replaced by a dummy argument for backwards compatibility with clients using positional arguments. The RPC is still used to change the apparent fee-rate of the transaction by using the fee_delta argument.\n-minrelaytxfee can now be set to 0. If minrelaytxfee is set, then fees smaller than minrelaytxfee (per kB) are rejected from relaying, mining and transaction creation. This defaults to 1000 satoshi/kB.\nThe -printpriority option has been updated to only output the fee rate and hash of transactions included in a block by the mining code.\n\nMempool Persistence Across Restarts\nVersion 0.14 introduced mempool persistence across restarts (the mempool is saved to a mempool.dat file in the data directory prior to shutdown and restores the mempool when the node is restarted). Version 0.15 allows this feature to be switched on or off using the -persistmempool command-line option (See PR 9966). By default, the option is set to true, and the mempool is saved on shutdown and reloaded on startup. If set to false, the mempool.dat file will not be loaded on startup or saved on shutdown.\nNew RPC methods\nVersion 0.15 introduces several new RPC methods:\n\nabortrescan stops current wallet rescan, e.g. when triggered by an importprivkey call (See PR 10208).\ncombinerawtransaction accepts a JSON array of raw transactions and combines them into a single raw transaction (See PR 10571).\nestimaterawfee returns raw fee data so that customized logic can be implemented to analyze the data and calculate estimates. See Fee Estimation Improvements for full details on changes to the fee estimation logic and interface.\ngetchaintxstats returns statistics about the total number and rate of transactions\nin the chain (See PR 9733).\nlistwallets lists wallets which are currently loaded. See the Multi-wallet section\nof these release notes for full details (See Multi-wallet support).\nuptime returns the total runtime of the bitcoind server since its last start (See PR 10400).\n\nLow-level RPC changes\n\n\nWhen using Bitcoin Core in multi-wallet mode, RPC requests for wallet methods must specify\nthe wallet that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re intended for. See Multi-wallet support for full details.\n\nThe new database model no longer stores information about transaction\nversions of unspent outputs (See Performance improvements). This means that:\n    \nThe gettxout RPC no longer has a version field in the response.\nThe gettxoutsetinfo RPC reports hash_serialized_2 instead of hash_serialized,\nwhich does not commit to the transaction versions of unspent outputs, but does\ncommit to the height and coinbase information.\nThe getutxos REST path no longer reports the txvers field in JSON format,\nand always reports 0 for transaction versions in the binary format\n\n\n\nThe estimatefee RPC is deprecated. Clients should switch to using the estimatesmartfee RPC, which returns better fee estimates. See Fee Estimation Improvements for full details on changes to the fee estimation logic and interface.\n\n\nThe gettxoutsetinfo response now contains disk_size and bogosize instead of\nbytes_serialized. The first is a more accurate estimate of actual disk usage, but\nis not deterministic. The second is unrelated to disk usage, but is a\ndatabase-independent metric of UTXO set size: it counts every UTXO entry as 50 + the\nlength of its scriptPubKey (See PR 10426).\n\n\nsignrawtransaction can no longer be used to combine multiple transactions into a single transaction. Instead, use the new combinerawtransaction RPC (See PR 10571).\n\n\nfundrawtransaction no longer accepts a reserveChangeKey option. This option used to allow RPC users to fund a raw transaction using an key from the keypool for the change address without removing it from the available keys in the keypool. The key could then be re-used for a getnewaddress call, which could potentially result in confusing or dangerous behaviour (See PR 10784).\n\n\nestimatepriority and estimatesmartpriority have been removed. See Removal of Coin Age Priority.\n\nThe listunspent RPC now takes a query_options argument (see PR 8952), which is a JSON object\ncontaining one or more of the following members:\n    \nminimumAmount - a number specifying the minimum value of each UTXO\nmaximumAmount - a number specifying the maximum value of each UTXO\nmaximumCount - a number specifying the minimum number of UTXOs\nminimumSumAmount - a number specifying the minimum sum value of all UTXOs\n\n\n\nThe getmempoolancestors, getmempooldescendants, getmempoolentry and getrawmempool RPCs no longer return startingpriority and currentpriority. See Removal of Coin Age Priority.\n\n\nThe dumpwallet RPC now returns the full absolute path to the dumped wallet. It\nused to return no value, even if successful (See PR 9740).\n\n\nIn the getpeerinfo RPC, the return object for each peer now returns an addrbind member, which contains the ip address and port of the connection to the peer. This is in addition to the addrlocal member which contains the ip address and port of the local node as reported by the peer (See PR 10478).\n\n\nThe disconnectnode RPC can now disconnect a node specified by node ID (as well as by IP address/port). To disconnect a node based on node ID, call the RPC with the new nodeid argument (See PR 10143).\n\n\nThe second argument in prioritisetransaction has been renamed from priority_delta to dummy since Bitcoin Core no longer has a concept of coin age priority. The dummy argument has no functional effect, but is retained for positional argument compatibility. See Removal of Coin Age Priority.\n\n\nThe resendwallettransactions RPC throws an error if the -walletbroadcast option is set to false (See PR 10995).\n\n\nThe second argument in the submitblock RPC argument has been renamed from parameters to dummy. This argument never had any effect, and the renaming is simply to communicate this fact to the user (See PR 10191)\n(Clients should, however, use positional arguments for submitblock in order to be compatible with BIP 22.)\n\n\nThe verbose argument of getblock has been renamed to verbosity and now takes an integer from 0 to 2. Verbose level 0 is equivalent to verbose=false. Verbose level 1 is equivalent to verbose=true. Verbose level 2 will give the full transaction details of each transaction in the output as given by getrawtransaction. The old behavior of using the verbose named argument and a boolean value is still maintained for compatibility.\n\nError codes have been updated to be more accurate for the following error cases (See PR 9853):\n    \ngetblock now returns RPC_MISC_ERROR if the block can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be found on disk (for\nexample if the block has been pruned). Previously returned RPC_INTERNAL_ERROR.\npruneblockchain now returns RPC_MISC_ERROR if the blocks cannot be pruned\nbecause the node is not in pruned mode. Previously returned RPC_METHOD_NOT_FOUND.\npruneblockchain now returns RPC_INVALID_PARAMETER if the blocks cannot be pruned\nbecause the supplied timestamp is too late. Previously returned RPC_INTERNAL_ERROR.\npruneblockchain now returns RPC_MISC_ERROR if the blocks cannot be pruned\nbecause the blockchain is too short. Previously returned RPC_INTERNAL_ERROR.\nsetban now returns RPC_CLIENT_INVALID_IP_OR_SUBNET if the supplied IP address\nor subnet is invalid. Previously returned RPC_CLIENT_NODE_ALREADY_ADDED.\nsetban now returns RPC_CLIENT_INVALID_IP_OR_SUBNET if the user tries to unban\na node that has not previously been banned. Previously returned RPC_MISC_ERROR.\nremoveprunedfunds now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if bitcoind is unable to remove\nthe transaction. Previously returned RPC_INTERNAL_ERROR.\nremoveprunedfunds now returns RPC_INVALID_PARAMETER if the transaction does not\nexist in the wallet. Previously returned RPC_INTERNAL_ERROR.\nfundrawtransaction now returns RPC_INVALID_ADDRESS_OR_KEY if an invalid change\naddress is provided. Previously returned RPC_INVALID_PARAMETER.\nfundrawtransaction now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if bitcoind is unable to create\nthe transaction. The error message provides further details. Previously returned\nRPC_INTERNAL_ERROR.\nbumpfee now returns RPC_INVALID_PARAMETER if the provided transaction has\ndescendants in the wallet. Previously returned RPC_MISC_ERROR.\nbumpfee now returns RPC_INVALID_PARAMETER if the provided transaction has\ndescendants in the mempool. Previously returned RPC_MISC_ERROR.\nbumpfee now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if the provided transaction has\nhas been mined or conflicts with a mined transaction. Previously returned\nRPC_INVALID_ADDRESS_OR_KEY.\nbumpfee now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if the provided transaction is not\nBIP 125 replaceable. Previously returned RPC_INVALID_ADDRESS_OR_KEY.\nbumpfee now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if the provided transaction has already\nbeen bumped by a different transaction. Previously returned RPC_INVALID_REQUEST.\nbumpfee now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if the provided transaction contains\ninputs which don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t belong to this wallet. Previously returned RPC_INVALID_ADDRESS_OR_KEY.\nbumpfee now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if the provided transaction has multiple change\noutputs. Previously returned RPC_MISC_ERROR.\nbumpfee now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if the provided transaction has no change\noutput. Previously returned RPC_MISC_ERROR.\nbumpfee now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if the fee is too high. Previously returned\nRPC_MISC_ERROR.\nbumpfee now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if the fee is too low. Previously returned\nRPC_MISC_ERROR.\nbumpfee now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if the change output is too small to bump the\nfee. Previously returned RPC_MISC_ERROR.\n\n\n\n0.15.0 Change log\nRPC and other APIs\n\n#9485 61a640e ZMQ example using python3 and asyncio (mcelrath)\n#9894 0496e15 remove

Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the \ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt</code> (on Mac)\nor <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoind</code>/<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin-qt</code> (on Linux).</p>\n<p>The first time you run version 0.15.0, your chainstate database will be converted to a\nnew format, which will take anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour,\ndepending on the speed of your machine.</p>\n<p>The file format of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">fee_estimates.dat</code> changed in version 0.15.0. Hence, a\ndowngrade from version 0.15.0 or upgrade to version 0.15.0 will cause all fee\nestimates to be discarded.</p>\n<p>Note that the block database format also changed in version 0.8.0 and there is no\nautomatic upgrade code from before version 0.8 to version 0.15.0. Upgrading\ndirectly from 0.7.x and earlier without redownloading the blockchain is not supported.\nHowever, as usual, old wallet versions are still supported.</p>\n<h2 id=\"downgrading-warning\">Downgrading warning</h2>\n<p>The chainstate database for this release is not compatible with previous\nreleases, so if you run 0.15 and then decide to switch back to any\nolder version, you will need to run the old release with the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-reindex-chainstate</code>\noption to rebuild the chainstate data structures in the old format.</p>\n<p>If your node has pruning enabled, this will entail re-downloading and\nprocessing the entire blockchain.</p>\n<h1 id=\"compatibility\">Compatibility</h1>\n<p>Bitcoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using\nthe Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later. Windows XP is not supported.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not\nfrequently tested on them.</p>\n<h1 id=\"notes-for-0150\">Notes for 0.15.0</h1>\n<h2 id=\"current-segwit-support\">Current SegWit support</h2>\n<p>Version 0.15.0 supports adding a segregated witness address via the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">addwitnessaddress</code> RPC, but\nplease note that this is a testing/expert RPC, which does not guarantee recovery from backup. Only use\nthis RPC if you know what you are doing. More complete wallet support for segregated witness is coming\nin a next version.</p>\n<h2 id=\"rescanning-with-encrypted-wallets\">Rescanning with encrypted wallets</h2>\n<p>As in previous versions, when using an encrypted HD wallet, the keypool cannot be topped up without unlocking\nthe wallet. This means that currently, in order to recover from a backup of an encrypted HD wallet, the user\nmust unlock the wallet with a really long timeout and manually trigger a rescan, otherwise they risk missing\nsome keys when auto-topup cannot run. Unfortunately there is no <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">rescan</code> RPC in this version, that will be\nincluded in a future version, so for now a rescan can be triggered using one of the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">import*</code> commands, using\na dummy address generated by another (trusted) wallet.</p>\n<h1 id=\"notable-changes\">Notable changes</h1>\n<h2 id=\"performance-improvements\">Performance Improvements</h2>\n<p>Version 0.15 contains a number of significant performance improvements, which make\nInitial Block Download, startup, transaction and block validation much faster:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The chainstate database (which is used for tracking UTXOs) has been changed\nfrom a per-transaction model to a per-output model (See <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10195\">PR 10195</a>). Advantages of this model\nare that it:\n    <ul>\n<li>avoids the CPU overhead of deserializing and serializing the unused outputs;</li>\n<li>has more predictable memory usage;</li>\n<li>uses simpler code;</li>\n<li>is adaptable to various future cache flushing strategies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a result, validating the blockchain during Initial Block Download (IBD) and reindex\nis ~30-40% faster, uses 10-20% less memory, and flushes to disk far less frequently.\nThe only downside is that the on-disk database is 15% larger. During the conversion from the previous format\na few extra gigabytes may be used.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Earlier versions experienced a spike in memory usage while flushing UTXO updates to disk.\nAs a result, only half of the available memory was actually used as cache, and the other half was\nreserved to accommodate flushing. This is no longer the case (See <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10148\">PR 10148</a>), and the entirety of\nthe available cache (see <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-dbcache</code>) is now actually used as cache. This reduces the flushing\nfrequency by a factor 2 or more.</li>\n<li>In previous versions, signature validation for transactions has been cached when the\ntransaction is accepted to the mempool. Version 0.15 extends this to cache the entire script\nvalidity (See <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10192\">PR 10192</a>). This means that if a transaction in a block has already been accepted to the\nmempool, the scriptSig does not need to be re-evaluated. Empirical tests show that\nthis results in new block validation being 40-50% faster.</li>\n<li>LevelDB has been upgraded to version 1.20 (See <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10544\">PR 10544</a>). This version contains hardware acceleration for CRC\non architectures supporting SSE 4.2. As a result, synchronization and block validation are now faster.</li>\n<li>SHA256 hashing has been optimized for architectures supporting SSE 4 (See <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10821\">PR 10821</a>). SHA256 is around\n50% faster on supported hardware, which results in around 5% faster IBD and block\nvalidation. In version 0.15, SHA256 hardware optimization is disabled in release builds by\ndefault, but can be enabled by using <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">--enable-experimental-asm</code> when building.</li>\n<li>Refill of the keypool no longer flushes the wallet between each key which resulted in a ~20x speedup in creating a new wallet. Part of this speedup was used to increase the default keypool to 1000 keys to make recovery more robust. (See <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10831\">PR 10831</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"fee-estimation-improvements\">Fee Estimation Improvements</h2>\n<p>Fee estimation has been significantly improved in version 0.15, with more accurate fee estimates used by the wallet and a wider range of options for advanced users of the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">estimatesmartfee</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">estimaterawfee</code> RPCs (See <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10199\">PR 10199</a>).</p>\n<h3 id=\"changes-to-internal-logic-and-wallet-behavior\">Changes to internal logic and wallet behavior</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Internally, estimates are now tracked on 3 different time horizons. This allows for longer targets and means estimates adjust more quickly to changes in conditions.</li>\n<li>Estimates can now be <em>conservative</em> or <em>economical</em>. <em>Conservative</em> estimates use longer time horizons to produce an estimate which is less susceptible to rapid changes in fee conditions. <em>Economical</em> estimates use shorter time horizons and will be more affected by short-term changes in fee conditions. Economical estimates may be considerably lower during periods of low transaction activity (for example over weekends), but may result in transactions being unconfirmed if prevailing fees increase rapidly.</li>\n<li>By default, the wallet will use conservative fee estimates to increase the reliability of transactions being confirmed within the desired target. For transactions that are marked as replaceable, the wallet will use an economical estimate by default, since the fee can be \u00e2\u0080\u0098bumped\u00e2\u0080\u0099 if the fee conditions change rapidly (See <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10589\">PR 10589</a>).</li>\n<li>Estimates can now be made for confirmation targets up to 1008 blocks (one week).</li>\n<li>More data on historical fee rates is stored, leading to more precise fee estimates.</li>\n<li>Transactions which leave the mempool due to eviction or other non-confirmed reasons are now taken into account by the fee estimation logic, leading to more accurate fee estimates.</li>\n<li>The fee estimation logic will make sure enough data has been gathered to return a meaningful estimate. If there is insufficient data, a fallback default fee is used.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"changes-to-fee-estimate-rpcs\">Changes to fee estimate RPCs</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">estimatefee</code> RPC is now deprecated in favor of using only <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">estimatesmartfee</code> (which is the implementation used by the GUI)</li>\n<li>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">estimatesmartfee</code> RPC interface has been changed (See <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10707\">PR 10707</a>):\n    <ul>\n<li>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">nblocks</code> argument has been renamed to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">conf_target</code> (to be consistent with other RPC methods).</li>\n<li>An <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">estimate_mode</code> argument has been added. This argument takes one of the following strings: <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">CONSERVATIVE</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">ECONOMICAL</code> or <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">UNSET</code> (which defaults to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">CONSERVATIVE</code>).</li>\n<li>The RPC return object now contains an <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">errors</code> member, which returns errors encountered during processing.</li>\n<li>If Bitcoin Core has not been running for long enough and has not seen enough blocks or transactions to produce an accurate fee estimation, an error will be returned (previously a value of -1 was used to indicate an error, which could be confused for a feerate).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A new <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">estimaterawfee</code> RPC is added to provide raw fee data. External clients can query and use this data in their own fee estimation logic.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"multi-wallet-support\">Multi-wallet support</h2>\n<p>Bitcoin Core now supports loading multiple, separate wallets (See <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8694\">PR 8694</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10849\">PR 10849</a>). The wallets are completely separated, with individual balances, keys and received transactions.</p>\n<p>Multi-wallet is enabled by using more than one <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-wallet</code> argument when starting Bitcoin, either on the command line or in the Bitcoin config file.</p>\n<p><strong>In Bitcoin-Qt, only the first wallet will be displayed and accessible for creating and signing transactions.</strong> GUI selectable multiple wallets will be supported in a future version. However, even in 0.15 other loaded wallets will remain synchronized to the node\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current tip in the background. This can be useful if running a pruned node, since loading a wallet where the most recent sync is beyond the pruned height results in having to download and revalidate the whole blockchain. Continuing to synchronize all wallets in the background avoids this problem.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin Core 0.15.0 contains the following changes to the RPC interface and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin-cli</code> for multi-wallet:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When running Bitcoin Core with a single wallet, there are <strong>no</strong> changes to the RPC interface or <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin-cli</code>. All RPC calls and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin-cli</code> commands continue to work as before.</li>\n<li>When running Bitcoin Core with multi-wallet, all <em>node-level</em> RPC methods continue to work as before. HTTP RPC requests should be send to the normal <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">&lt;RPC IP address&gt;:&lt;RPC port&gt;</code> endpoint, and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin-cli</code> commands should be run as before. A <em>node-level</em> RPC method is any method which does not require access to the wallet.</li>\n<li>When running Bitcoin Core with multi-wallet, <em>wallet-level</em> RPC methods must specify the wallet for which they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re intended in every request. HTTP RPC requests should be send to the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">&lt;RPC IP address&gt;:&lt;RPC port&gt;/wallet/&lt;wallet name&gt;</code> endpoint, for example <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">127.0.0.1:8332/wallet/wallet1.dat</code>. <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin-cli</code> commands should be run with a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-rpcwallet</code> option, for example <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=wallet1.dat getbalance</code>.</li>\n<li>A new <em>node-level</em> <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">listwallets</code> RPC method is added to display which wallets are currently loaded. The names returned by this method are the same as those used in the HTTP endpoint and for the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">rpcwallet</code> argument.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that while multi-wallet is now fully supported, the RPC multi-wallet interface should be considered unstable for version 0.15.0, and there may backwards-incompatible changes in future versions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"replace-by-fee-control-in-the-gui\">Replace-by-fee control in the GUI</h2>\n<p>Bitcoin Core has supported creating opt-in replace-by-fee (RBF) transactions\nsince version 0.12.0, and since version 0.14.0 has included a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bumpfee</code> RPC method to\nreplace unconfirmed opt-in RBF transactions with a new transaction that pays\na higher fee.</p>\n<p>In version 0.15, creating an opt-in RBF transaction and replacing the unconfirmed\ntransaction with a higher-fee transaction are both supported in the GUI (See <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9592\">PR 9592</a>).</p>\n<h2 id=\"removal-of-coin-age-priority\">Removal of Coin Age Priority</h2>\n<p>In previous versions of Bitcoin Core, a portion of each block could be reserved for transactions based on the age and value of UTXOs they spent. This concept (Coin Age Priority) is a policy choice by miners, and there are no consensus rules around the inclusion of Coin Age Priority transactions in blocks. In practice, only a few miners continue to use Coin Age Priority for transaction selection in blocks. Bitcoin Core 0.15 removes all remaining support for Coin Age Priority (See <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9602\">PR 9602</a>). This has the following implications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The concept of <em>free transactions</em> has been removed. High Coin Age Priority transactions would previously be allowed to be relayed even if they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t attach a miner fee. This is no longer possible since there is no concept of Coin Age Priority. The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-limitfreerelay</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-relaypriority</code> options which controlled relay of free transactions have therefore been removed.</li>\n<li>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-sendfreetransactions</code> option has been removed, since almost all miners do not include transactions which do not attach a transaction fee.</li>\n<li>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-blockprioritysize</code> option has been removed.</li>\n<li>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">estimatepriority</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">estimatesmartpriority</code> RPCs have been removed.</li>\n<li>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getmempoolancestors</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getmempooldescendants</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getmempoolentry</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getrawmempool</code> RPCs no longer return <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">startingpriority</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">currentpriority</code>.</li>\n<li>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">prioritisetransaction</code> RPC no longer takes a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">priority_delta</code> argument, which is replaced by a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">dummy</code> argument for backwards compatibility with clients using positional arguments. The RPC is still used to change the apparent fee-rate of the transaction by using the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">fee_delta</code> argument.</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-minrelaytxfee</code> can now be set to 0. If <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">minrelaytxfee</code> is set, then fees smaller than <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">minrelaytxfee</code> (per kB) are rejected from relaying, mining and transaction creation. This defaults to 1000 satoshi/kB.</li>\n<li>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-printpriority</code> option has been updated to only output the fee rate and hash of transactions included in a block by the mining code.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"mempool-persistence-across-restarts\">Mempool Persistence Across Restarts</h2>\n<p>Version 0.14 introduced mempool persistence across restarts (the mempool is saved to a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">mempool.dat</code> file in the data directory prior to shutdown and restores the mempool when the node is restarted). Version 0.15 allows this feature to be switched on or off using the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-persistmempool</code> command-line option (See <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9966\">PR 9966</a>). By default, the option is set to true, and the mempool is saved on shutdown and reloaded on startup. If set to false, the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">mempool.dat</code> file will not be loaded on startup or saved on shutdown.</p>\n<h2 id=\"new-rpc-methods\">New RPC methods</h2>\n<p>Version 0.15 introduces several new RPC methods:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">abortrescan</code> stops current wallet rescan, e.g. when triggered by an <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">importprivkey</code> call (See <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10208\">PR 10208</a>).</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">combinerawtransaction</code> accepts a JSON array of raw transactions and combines them into a single raw transaction (See <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10571\">PR 10571</a>).</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">estimaterawfee</code> returns raw fee data so that customized logic can be implemented to analyze the data and calculate estimates. See <a href=\"#fee-estimation-improvements\">Fee Estimation Improvements</a> for full details on changes to the fee estimation logic and interface.</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getchaintxstats</code> returns statistics about the total number and rate of transactions\nin the chain (See <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9733\">PR 9733</a>).</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">listwallets</code> lists wallets which are currently loaded. See the <em>Multi-wallet</em> section\nof these release notes for full details (See <a href=\"#multi-wallet-support\">Multi-wallet support</a>).</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">uptime</code> returns the total runtime of the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoind</code> server since its last start (See <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10400\">PR 10400</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"low-level-rpc-changes\">Low-level RPC changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>When using Bitcoin Core in multi-wallet mode, RPC requests for wallet methods must specify\nthe wallet that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re intended for. See <a href=\"#multi-wallet-support\">Multi-wallet support</a> for full details.</p>\n</li>\n<li>The new database model no longer stores information about transaction\nversions of unspent outputs (See <a href=\"#performance-improvements\">Performance improvements</a>). This means that:\n    <ul>\n<li>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">gettxout</code> RPC no longer has a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">version</code> field in the response.</li>\n<li>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">gettxoutsetinfo</code> RPC reports <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">hash_serialized_2</code> instead of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">hash_serialized</code>,\nwhich does not commit to the transaction versions of unspent outputs, but does\ncommit to the height and coinbase information.</li>\n<li>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getutxos</code> REST path no longer reports the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">txvers</code> field in JSON format,\nand always reports 0 for transaction versions in the binary format</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">estimatefee</code> RPC is deprecated. Clients should switch to using the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">estimatesmartfee</code> RPC, which returns better fee estimates. See <a href=\"#fee-estimation-improvements\">Fee Estimation Improvements</a> for full details on changes to the fee estimation logic and interface.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">gettxoutsetinfo</code> response now contains <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">disk_size</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bogosize</code> instead of\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bytes_serialized</code>. The first is a more accurate estimate of actual disk usage, but\nis not deterministic. The second is unrelated to disk usage, but is a\ndatabase-independent metric of UTXO set size: it counts every UTXO entry as 50 + the\nlength of its scriptPubKey (See <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10426\">PR 10426</a>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">signrawtransaction</code> can no longer be used to combine multiple transactions into a single transaction. Instead, use the new <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">combinerawtransaction</code> RPC (See <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10571\">PR 10571</a>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">fundrawtransaction</code> no longer accepts a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">reserveChangeKey</code> option. This option used to allow RPC users to fund a raw transaction using an key from the keypool for the change address without removing it from the available keys in the keypool. The key could then be re-used for a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getnewaddress</code> call, which could potentially result in confusing or dangerous behaviour (See <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10784\">PR 10784</a>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">estimatepriority</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">estimatesmartpriority</code> have been removed. See <a href=\"#removal-of-coin-age-priority\">Removal of Coin Age Priority</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">listunspent</code> RPC now takes a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">query_options</code> argument (see <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8952\">PR 8952</a>), which is a JSON object\ncontaining one or more of the following members:\n    <ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">minimumAmount</code> - a number specifying the minimum value of each UTXO</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">maximumAmount</code> - a number specifying the maximum value of each UTXO</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">maximumCount</code> - a number specifying the minimum number of UTXOs</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">minimumSumAmount</code> - a number specifying the minimum sum value of all UTXOs</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getmempoolancestors</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getmempooldescendants</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getmempoolentry</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getrawmempool</code> RPCs no longer return <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">startingpriority</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">currentpriority</code>. See <a href=\"#removal-of-coin-age-priority\">Removal of Coin Age Priority</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">dumpwallet</code> RPC now returns the full absolute path to the dumped wallet. It\nused to return no value, even if successful (See <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9740\">PR 9740</a>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getpeerinfo</code> RPC, the return object for each peer now returns an <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">addrbind</code> member, which contains the ip address and port of the connection to the peer. This is in addition to the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">addrlocal</code> member which contains the ip address and port of the local node as reported by the peer (See <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10478\">PR 10478</a>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">disconnectnode</code> RPC can now disconnect a node specified by node ID (as well as by IP address/port). To disconnect a node based on node ID, call the RPC with the new <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">nodeid</code> argument (See <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10143\">PR 10143</a>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The second argument in <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">prioritisetransaction</code> has been renamed from <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">priority_delta</code> to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">dummy</code> since Bitcoin Core no longer has a concept of coin age priority. The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">dummy</code> argument has no functional effect, but is retained for positional argument compatibility. See <a href=\"#removal-of-coin-age-priority\">Removal of Coin Age Priority</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">resendwallettransactions</code> RPC throws an error if the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-walletbroadcast</code> option is set to false (See <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10995\">PR 10995</a>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The second argument in the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">submitblock</code> RPC argument has been renamed from <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">parameters</code> to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">dummy</code>. This argument never had any effect, and the renaming is simply to communicate this fact to the user (See <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10191\">PR 10191</a>)\n(Clients should, however, use positional arguments for <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">submitblock</code> in order to be compatible with BIP 22.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">verbose</code> argument of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getblock</code> has been renamed to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">verbosity</code> and now takes an integer from 0 to 2. Verbose level 0 is equivalent to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">verbose=false</code>. Verbose level 1 is equivalent to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">verbose=true</code>. Verbose level 2 will give the full transaction details of each transaction in the output as given by <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getrawtransaction</code>. The old behavior of using the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">verbose</code> named argument and a boolean value is still maintained for compatibility.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Error codes have been updated to be more accurate for the following error cases (See <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9853\">PR 9853</a>):\n    <ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getblock</code> now returns RPC_MISC_ERROR if the block can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be found on disk (for\nexample if the block has been pruned).

It is recommended to upgrade any of\nthe vulnerable versions to 0.14.3, 0.15.2 or 0.16.3 as soon as possible.\nKnown Bugs\nSince 0.14.0 the approximate transaction fee shown in Bitcoin-Qt when using coin\ncontrol and smart fee estimation does not reflect any change in target from the\nsmart fee slider. It will only present an approximate fee calculated using the\ndefault target. The fee calculated using the correct target is still applied to\nthe transaction and shown in the final send confirmation dialog.\n0.14.3 Change log\nDetailed release notes follow.

Client software\nusing these calls with named arguments needs to be updated.\nMining\nIn previous versions, getblocktemplate required segwit support from downstream\nclients/miners once the feature activated on the network. In this version, it\nnow supports non-segwit clients even after activation, by removing all segwit\ntransactions from the returned block template. This allows non-segwit miners to\ncontinue functioning correctly even after segwit has activated.\nDue to the limitations in previous versions, getblocktemplate also recommended\nnon-segwit clients to not signal for the segwit version-bit. Since this is no\nlonger an issue, getblocktemplate now always recommends signalling segwit for\nall miners. This is safe because ability to enforce the rule is the only\nrequired criteria for safe activation, not actually producing segwit-enabled\nblocks.\nUTXO memory accounting\nMemory usage for the UTXO cache is being calculated more accurately, so that\nthe configured limit (-dbcache) will be respected when memory usage peaks\nduring cache flushes.  The memory accounting in prior releases is estimated to\nonly account for half the actual peak utilization.\nThe default -dbcache has also been changed in this release to 450MiB.  Users\nwho currently set -dbcache to a high value (e.g. to keep the UTXO more fully\ncached in memory) should consider increasing this setting in order to achieve\nthe same cache performance as prior releases.  Users on low-memory systems\n(such as systems with 1GB or less) should consider specifying a lower value for\nthis parameter.\nAdditional information relating to running on low-memory systems can be found\nhere:\nreducing-bitcoind-memory-usage.md.\n0.14.1 Change log\nDetailed release notes follow.

tested on multiple operating systems using\nthe Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later.</p>\n<p>Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/end-of-xp-support\">April 8th, 2014</a>,\nNo attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP, you\ncan still do so at your own risk but be aware that there are known instabilities and issues.\nPlease do not report issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not\nfrequently tested on them.</p>\n<h1 id=\"notable-changes\">Notable changes</h1>\n<h2 id=\"rpc-changes\">RPC changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The first positional argument of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">createrawtransaction</code> was renamed from\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">transactions</code> to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">inputs</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The argument of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">disconnectnode</code> was renamed from <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">node</code> to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">address</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These interface changes break compatibility with 0.14.0, when the named\narguments functionality, introduced in 0.14.0, is used. Client software\nusing these calls with named arguments needs to be updated.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mining\">Mining</h2>\n<p>In previous versions, getblocktemplate required segwit support from downstream\nclients/miners once the feature activated on the network. In this version, it\nnow supports non-segwit clients even after activation, by removing all segwit\ntransactions from the returned block template. This allows non-segwit miners to\ncontinue functioning correctly even after segwit has activated.</p>\n<p>Due to the limitations in previous versions, getblocktemplate also recommended\nnon-segwit clients to not signal for the segwit version-bit. Since this is no\nlonger an issue, getblocktemplate now always recommends signalling segwit for\nall miners. This is safe because ability to enforce the rule is the only\nrequired criteria for safe activation, not actually producing segwit-enabled\nblocks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"utxo-memory-accounting\">UTXO memory accounting</h2>\n<p>Memory usage for the UTXO cache is being calculated more accurately, so that\nthe configured limit (<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-dbcache</code>) will be respected when memory usage peaks\nduring cache flushes.  The memory accounting in prior releases is estimated to\nonly account for half the actual peak utilization.</p>\n<p>The default <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-dbcache</code> has also been changed in this release to 450MiB.  Users\nwho currently set <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-dbcache</code> to a high value (e.g. to keep the UTXO more fully\ncached in memory) should consider increasing this setting in order to achieve\nthe same cache performance as prior releases.  Users on low-memory systems\n(such as systems with 1GB or less) should consider specifying a lower value for\nthis parameter.</p>\n<p>Additional information relating to running on low-memory systems can be found\nhere:\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/laanwj/efe29c7661ce9b6620a7\">reducing-bitcoind-memory-usage.md</a>.</p>\n<h1 id=\"0141-change-log\">0.14.1 Change log</h1>\n<p>Detailed release notes follow.

See below for more details.\nIn some cases, compact blocks are now relayed before being fully validated as\nper BIP152.\nP2P networking has been refactored with a focus on concurrency and\nthroughput. Network operations are no longer bottlenecked by validation. As a\nresult, block fetching is several times faster than previous releases in many\ncases.\nThe UTXO cache now claims unused mempool memory. This speeds up initial block\ndownload as UTXO lookups are a major bottleneck there, and there is no use for\nthe mempool at that stage.\n\nManual Pruning\nBitcoin Core has supported automatically pruning the blockchain since 0.11. Pruning\nthe blockchain allows for significant storage space savings as the vast majority of\nthe downloaded data can be discarded after processing so very little of it remains\non the disk.\nManual block pruning can now be enabled by setting -prune=1. Once that is set,\nthe RPC command pruneblockchain can be used to prune the blockchain up to the\nspecified height or timestamp.\ngetinfo Deprecated\nThe getinfo RPC command has been deprecated. Each field in the RPC call\nhas been moved to another command\u00e2\u0080\u0099s output with that command also giving\nadditional information that getinfo did not provide. The following table\nshows where each field has been moved to:\n\n\n\ngetinfo field\nMoved to\n\n\n\n\n\"version\"\ngetnetworkinfo()[\"version\"]\n\n\n\"protocolversion\"\ngetnetworkinfo()[\"protocolversion\"]\n\n\n\"walletversion\"\ngetwalletinfo()[\"walletversion\"]\n\n\n\"balance\"\ngetwalletinfo()[\"balance\"]\n\n\n\"blocks\"\ngetblockchaininfo()[\"blocks\"]\n\n\n\"timeoffset\"\ngetnetworkinfo()[\"timeoffset\"]\n\n\n\"connections\"\ngetnetworkinfo()[\"connections\"]\n\n\n\"proxy\"\ngetnetworkinfo()[\"networks\"][0][\"proxy\"] \n\n\n\"difficulty\"\ngetblockchaininfo()[\"difficulty\"]\n\n\n\"testnet\"\ngetblockchaininfo()[\"chain\"] == \"test\"\n\n\n\"keypoololdest\"\ngetwalletinfo()[\"keypoololdest\"]\n\n\n\"keypoolsize\"\ngetwalletinfo()[\"keypoolsize\"]\n\n\n\"unlocked_until\"\ngetwalletinfo()[\"unlocked_until\"]\n\n\n\"paytxfee\"\ngetwalletinfo()[\"paytxfee\"]\n\n\n\"relayfee\"\ngetnetworkinfo()[\"relayfee\"]\n\n\n\"errors\"\ngetnetworkinfo()[\"warnings\"]\n\n\n\nZMQ On Windows\nPreviously the ZeroMQ notification system was unavailable on Windows\ndue to various issues with ZMQ. These have been fixed upstream and\nnow ZMQ can be used on Windows. Please see this document for\nhelp with using ZMQ in general.\nNested RPC Commands in Debug Console\nThe ability to nest RPC commands has been added to the debug console. This\nallows users to have the output of a command become the input to another\ncommand without running the commands separately.\nThe nested RPC commands use bracket syntax (i.e. getwalletinfo()) and can\nbe nested (i.e. getblock(getblockhash(1))). Simple queries can be\ndone with square brackets where object values are accessed with either an \narray index or a non-quoted string (i.e. listunspent()[0][txid]).  Both\ncommas and spaces can be used to separate parameters in both the bracket syntax\nand normal RPC command syntax.\nNetwork Activity Toggle\nA RPC command and GUI toggle have been added to enable or disable all p2p\nnetwork activity. The network status icon in the bottom right hand corner \nis now the GUI toggle. Clicking the icon will either enable or disable all\np2p network activity. If network activity is disabled, the icon will \nbe grayed out with an X on top of it.\nAdditionally the setnetworkactive RPC command has been added which does\nthe same thing as the GUI icon. The command takes one boolean parameter,\ntrue enables networking and false disables it.\nOut-of-sync Modal Info Layer\nWhen Bitcoin Core is out-of-sync on startup, a semi-transparent information\nlayer will be shown over top of the normal display. This layer contains\ndetails about the current sync progress and estimates the amount of time\nremaining to finish syncing. This layer can also be hidden and subsequently\nunhidden by clicking on the progress bar at the bottom of the window.\nSupport for JSON-RPC Named Arguments\nCommands sent over the JSON-RPC interface and through the bitcoin-cli binary\ncan now use named arguments. This follows the JSON-RPC specification\nfor passing parameters by-name with an object.\nbitcoin-cli has been updated to support this by parsing name=value arguments\nwhen the -named option is given.\nSome examples:\nsrc/bitcoin-cli -named help command=\"help\"\nsrc/bitcoin-cli -named getblockhash height=0\nsrc/bitcoin-cli -named getblock blockhash=000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f\nsrc/bitcoin-cli -named sendtoaddress address=\"(snip)\" amount=\"1.0\" subtractfeefromamount=true\n\nThe order of arguments doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter in this case. Named arguments are also\nuseful to leave out arguments that should stay at their default value. The\nrarely-used arguments comment and comment_to to sendtoaddress, for example, can\nbe left out. However, this is not yet implemented for many RPC calls, this is\nexpected to land in a later release.\nThe RPC server remains fully backwards compatible with positional arguments.\nOpt into RBF When Sending\nA new startup option, -walletrbf, has been added to allow users to have all\ntransactions sent opt into RBF support. The default value for this option is\ncurrently false, so transactions will not opt into RBF by default. The new\nbumpfee RPC can be used to replace transactions that opt into RBF.\nSensitive Data Is No Longer Stored In Debug Console History\nThe debug console maintains a history of previously entered commands that can be\naccessed by pressing the Up-arrow key so that users can easily reuse previously\nentered commands. Commands which have sensitive information such as passphrases and\nprivate keys will now have a (...) in place of the parameters when accessed through\nthe history.\nRetaining the Mempool Across Restarts\nThe mempool will be saved to the data directory prior to shutdown\nto a mempool.dat file. This file preserves the mempool so that when the node\nrestarts the mempool can be filled with transactions without waiting for new transactions\nto be created. This will also preserve any changes made to a transaction through\ncommands such as prioritisetransaction so that those changes will not be lost.\nFinal Alert\nThe Alert System was disabled and deprecated in Bitcoin Core 0.12.1 and removed in 0.13.0. \nThe Alert System was retired with a maximum sequence final alert which causes any nodes\nsupporting the Alert System to display a static hard-coded \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlert Key Compromised\u00e2\u0080\u009d message which also\nprevents any other alerts from overriding it. This final alert is hard-coded into this release\nso that all old nodes receive the final alert.\nGUI Changes\n\n\nAfter resetting the options by clicking the Reset Options button \nin the options dialog or with the -resetguioptions startup option, \nthe user will be prompted to choose the data directory again. This \nis to ensure that custom data directories will be kept after the \noption reset which clears the custom data directory set via the choose \ndatadir dialog.\n\n\nMultiple peers can now be selected in the list of peers in the debug \nwindow. This allows for users to ban or disconnect multiple peers \nsimultaneously instead of banning them one at a time.\n\n\nAn indicator has been added to the bottom right hand corner of the main\nwindow to indicate whether the wallet being used is a HD wallet. This\nicon will be grayed out with an X on top of it if the wallet is not a\nHD wallet.\n\n\nLow-level RPC changes\n\n\nimportprunedfunds only accepts two required arguments. Some versions accept\nan optional third arg, which was always ignored. Make sure to never pass more\nthan two arguments.\n\n\nThe first boolean argument to getaddednodeinfo has been removed. This is \nan incompatible change.\n\n\nRPC command getmininginfo loses the \u00e2\u0080\u009ctestnet\u00e2\u0080\u009d field in favor of the more\ngeneric \u00e2\u0080\u009cchain\u00e2\u0080\u009d (which has been present for years).\n\n\nA new RPC command preciousblock has been added which marks a block as\nprecious. A precious block will be treated as if it were received earlier\nthan a competing block.\n\n\nA new RPC command importmulti has been added which receives an array of \nJSON objects representing the intention of importing a public key, a \nprivate key, an address and script/p2sh\n\n\nUse of getrawtransaction for retrieving confirmed transactions with unspent\noutputs has been deprecated. For now this will still work, but in the future\nit may change to only be able to retrieve information about transactions in\nthe mempool or if txindex is enabled.\n\n\nA new RPC command getmemoryinfo has been added which will return information\nabout the memory usage of Bitcoin Core. This was added in conjunction with\noptimizations to memory management. See Pull #8753\nfor more information.\n\n\nA new RPC command bumpfee has been added which allows replacing an\nunconfirmed wallet transaction that signaled RBF (see the -walletrbf\nstartup option above) with a new transaction that pays a higher fee, and\nshould be more likely to get confirmed quickly.\n\n\nHTTP REST Changes\n\nUTXO set query (GET /rest/getutxos/<checkmempool>/<txid>-<n>/<txid>-<n>\n/.../<txid>-<n>.<bin|hex|json>) responses were changed to return status \ncode HTTP_BAD_REQUEST (400) instead of HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR (500)\nwhen requests contain invalid parameters.\n\nMinimum Fee Rate Policies\nSince the changes in 0.12 to automatically limit the size of the mempool and improve the performance of block creation in mining code it has not been important for relay nodes or miners to set -minrelaytxfee. With this release the following concepts that were tied to this option have been separated out:\n\nincremental relay fee used for calculating BIP 125 replacement and mempool limiting. (1000 satoshis/kB)\ncalculation of threshold for a dust output. (effectively 3 * 1000 satoshis/kB)\nminimum fee rate of a package of transactions to be included in a block created by the mining code. If miners wish to set this minimum they can use the new -blockmintxfee option.  (defaults to 1000 satoshis/kB)\n\nThe -minrelaytxfee option continues to exist but is recommended to be left unset.\nFee Estimation Changes\n\n\nSince 0.13.2 fee estimation for a confirmation target of 1 block has been\ndisabled. The fee slider will no longer be able to choose a target of 1 block.\nThis is only a minor behavior change as there was often insufficient\ndata for this target anyway. estimatefee 1 will now always return -1 and\nestimatesmartfee 1 will start searching at a target of 2.\n\n\nThe default target for fee estimation is changed to 6 blocks in both the GUI\n(previously 25) and for RPC calls (previously 2).\n\n\nRemoval of Priority Estimation\n\n\nEstimation of \u00e2\u0080\u009cpriority\u00e2\u0080\u009d needed for a transaction to be included within a target\nnumber of blocks has been removed.  The RPC calls are deprecated and will either\nreturn -1 or 1e24 appropriately. The format for fee_estimates.dat has also\nchanged to no longer save these priority estimates. It will automatically be\nconverted to the new format which is not readable by prior versions of the\nsoftware.\n\n\nSupport for \u00e2\u0080\u009cpriority\u00e2\u0080\u009d (coin age) transaction sorting for mining is\nconsidered deprecated in Core and will be removed in the next major version.\nThis is not to be confused with the prioritisetransaction RPC which will remain\nsupported by Core for adding fee deltas to transactions.\n\n\nP2P connection management\n\n\nPeers manually added through the -addnode option or addnode RPC now have their own\nlimit of eight connections which does not compete with other inbound or outbound\nconnection usage and is not subject to the limitation imposed by the -maxconnections\noption.\n\n\nNew connections to manually added peers are performed more quickly.\n\n\nIntroduction of assumed-valid blocks\n\n\nA significant portion of the initial block download time is spent verifying\nscripts/signatures.  Although the verification must pass to ensure the security\nof the system, no other result from this verification is needed: If the node\nknew the history of a given block were valid it could skip checking scripts\nfor its ancestors.\n\n\nA new configuration option \u00e2\u0080\u0098assumevalid\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is provided to express this knowledge\nto the software.  Unlike the \u00e2\u0080\u0098checkpoints\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in the past this setting does not\nforce the use of a particular chain: chains that are consistent with it are\nprocessed quicker, but other chains are still accepted if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d otherwise\nbe chosen as best. Also unlike \u00e2\u0080\u0098checkpoints\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the user can configure which\nblock history is assumed true, this means that even outdated software can\nsync more quickly if the setting is updated by the user.\n\n\nBecause the validity of a chain history is a simple objective fact it is much\neasier to review this setting.  As a result the software ships with a default\nvalue adjusted to match the current chain shortly before release.  The use\nof this default value can be disabled by setting -assumevalid=0\n\n\nFundrawtransaction change address reuse\n\n\nBefore 0.14, fundrawtransaction was by default wallet stateless. In\nalmost all cases fundrawtransaction does add a change-output to the\noutputs of the funded transaction. Before 0.14, the used keypool key was\nnever marked as change-address key and directly returned to the keypool\n(leading to address reuse).  Before 0.14, calling getnewaddress\ndirectly after fundrawtransaction did generate the same address as\nthe change-output address.\n\n\nSince 0.14, fundrawtransaction does reserve the change-output-key from\nthe keypool by default (optional by setting  reserveChangeKey, default =\ntrue)\n\n\nUsers should also consider using getrawchangeaddress() in conjunction\nwith fundrawtransaction\u00e2\u0080\u0099s changeAddress option.\n\n\nUnused mempool memory used by coincache\n\nBefore 0.14, memory reserved for mempool (using the -maxmempool option)\nwent unused during initial block download, or IBD. In 0.14, the UTXO DB cache\n(controlled with the -dbcache option) borrows memory from the mempool\nwhen there is extra memory available. This may result in an increase in\nmemory usage during IBD for those previously relying on only the -dbcache\noption to limit memory during that time.\n\n0.14.0 Change log\nDetailed release notes follow.

See below for more details.</li>\n<li>In some cases, compact blocks are now relayed before being fully validated as\nper BIP152.</li>\n<li>P2P networking has been refactored with a focus on concurrency and\nthroughput. Network operations are no longer bottlenecked by validation. As a\nresult, block fetching is several times faster than previous releases in many\ncases.</li>\n<li>The UTXO cache now claims unused mempool memory. This speeds up initial block\ndownload as UTXO lookups are a major bottleneck there, and there is no use for\nthe mempool at that stage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"manual-pruning\">Manual Pruning</h2>\n<p>Bitcoin Core has supported automatically pruning the blockchain since 0.11. Pruning\nthe blockchain allows for significant storage space savings as the vast majority of\nthe downloaded data can be discarded after processing so very little of it remains\non the disk.</p>\n<p>Manual block pruning can now be enabled by setting <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-prune=1</code>. Once that is set,\nthe RPC command <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">pruneblockchain</code> can be used to prune the blockchain up to the\nspecified height or timestamp.</p>\n<h2 id=\"getinfo-deprecated\"><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getinfo</code> Deprecated</h2>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getinfo</code> RPC command has been deprecated. Each field in the RPC call\nhas been moved to another command\u00e2\u0080\u0099s output with that command also giving\nadditional information that <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getinfo</code> did not provide. The following table\nshows where each field has been moved to:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getinfo</code> field</th>\n<th>Moved to</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">\"version\"</code></td>\n<td><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getnetworkinfo()[\"version\"]</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">\"protocolversion\"</code></td>\n<td><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getnetworkinfo()[\"protocolversion\"]</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">\"walletversion\"</code></td>\n<td><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getwalletinfo()[\"walletversion\"]</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">\"balance\"</code></td>\n<td><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getwalletinfo()[\"balance\"]</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">\"blocks\"</code></td>\n<td><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getblockchaininfo()[\"blocks\"]</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">\"timeoffset\"</code></td>\n<td><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getnetworkinfo()[\"timeoffset\"]</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">\"connections\"</code></td>\n<td><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getnetworkinfo()[\"connections\"]</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">\"proxy\"</code></td>\n<td><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getnetworkinfo()[\"networks\"][0][\"proxy\"]</code> <!--skip-test--></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">\"difficulty\"</code></td>\n<td><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getblockchaininfo()[\"difficulty\"]</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">\"testnet\"</code></td>\n<td><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getblockchaininfo()[\"chain\"] == \"test\"</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">\"keypoololdest\"</code></td>\n<td><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getwalletinfo()[\"keypoololdest\"]</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">\"keypoolsize\"</code></td>\n<td><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getwalletinfo()[\"keypoolsize\"]</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">\"unlocked_until\"</code></td>\n<td><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getwalletinfo()[\"unlocked_until\"]</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">\"paytxfee\"</code></td>\n<td><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getwalletinfo()[\"paytxfee\"]</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">\"relayfee\"</code></td>\n<td><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getnetworkinfo()[\"relayfee\"]</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">\"errors\"</code></td>\n<td><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getnetworkinfo()[\"warnings\"]</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"zmq-on-windows\">ZMQ On Windows</h2>\n<p>Previously the ZeroMQ notification system was unavailable on Windows\ndue to various issues with ZMQ. These have been fixed upstream and\nnow ZMQ can be used on Windows. Please see <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/zmq.md\">this document</a> for\nhelp with using ZMQ in general.</p>\n<h2 id=\"nested-rpc-commands-in-debug-console\">Nested RPC Commands in Debug Console</h2>\n<p>The ability to nest RPC commands has been added to the debug console. This\nallows users to have the output of a command become the input to another\ncommand without running the commands separately.</p>\n<p>The nested RPC commands use bracket syntax (i.e. <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getwalletinfo()</code>) and can\nbe nested (i.e. <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getblock(getblockhash(1))</code>). Simple queries can be\ndone with square brackets where object values are accessed with either an \narray index or a non-quoted string (i.e. <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">listunspent()[0][txid]</code>). <!--skip-test--> Both\ncommas and spaces can be used to separate parameters in both the bracket syntax\nand normal RPC command syntax.</p>\n<h2 id=\"network-activity-toggle\">Network Activity Toggle</h2>\n<p>A RPC command and GUI toggle have been added to enable or disable all p2p\nnetwork activity. The network status icon in the bottom right hand corner \nis now the GUI toggle. Clicking the icon will either enable or disable all\np2p network activity. If network activity is disabled, the icon will \nbe grayed out with an X on top of it.</p>\n<p>Additionally the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">setnetworkactive</code> RPC command has been added which does\nthe same thing as the GUI icon. The command takes one boolean parameter,\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">true</code> enables networking and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">false</code> disables it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"out-of-sync-modal-info-layer\">Out-of-sync Modal Info Layer</h2>\n<p>When Bitcoin Core is out-of-sync on startup, a semi-transparent information\nlayer will be shown over top of the normal display. This layer contains\ndetails about the current sync progress and estimates the amount of time\nremaining to finish syncing. This layer can also be hidden and subsequently\nunhidden by clicking on the progress bar at the bottom of the window.</p>\n<h2 id=\"support-for-json-rpc-named-arguments\">Support for JSON-RPC Named Arguments</h2>\n<p>Commands sent over the JSON-RPC interface and through the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin-cli</code> binary\ncan now use named arguments. This follows the <a href=\"http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification\">JSON-RPC specification</a>\nfor passing parameters by-name with an object.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin-cli</code> has been updated to support this by parsing <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">name=value</code> arguments\nwhen the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-named</code> option is given.</p>\n<p>Some examples:</p>\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>src/bitcoin-cli -named help command=\"help\"\nsrc/bitcoin-cli -named getblockhash height=0\nsrc/bitcoin-cli -named getblock blockhash=000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f\nsrc/bitcoin-cli -named sendtoaddress address=\"(snip)\" amount=\"1.0\" subtractfeefromamount=true\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>The order of arguments doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter in this case. Named arguments are also\nuseful to leave out arguments that should stay at their default value. The\nrarely-used arguments <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">comment</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">comment_to</code> to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">sendtoaddress</code>, for example, can\nbe left out. However, this is not yet implemented for many RPC calls, this is\nexpected to land in a later release.</p>\n<p>The RPC server remains fully backwards compatible with positional arguments.</p>\n<h2 id=\"opt-into-rbf-when-sending\">Opt into RBF When Sending</h2>\n<p>A new startup option, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-walletrbf</code>, has been added to allow users to have all\ntransactions sent opt into RBF support. The default value for this option is\ncurrently <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">false</code>, so transactions will not opt into RBF by default. The new\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bumpfee</code> RPC can be used to replace transactions that opt into RBF.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sensitive-data-is-no-longer-stored-in-debug-console-history\">Sensitive Data Is No Longer Stored In Debug Console History</h2>\n<p>The debug console maintains a history of previously entered commands that can be\naccessed by pressing the Up-arrow key so that users can easily reuse previously\nentered commands. Commands which have sensitive information such as passphrases and\nprivate keys will now have a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">(...)</code> in place of the parameters when accessed through\nthe history.</p>\n<h2 id=\"retaining-the-mempool-across-restarts\">Retaining the Mempool Across Restarts</h2>\n<p>The mempool will be saved to the data directory prior to shutdown\nto a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">mempool.dat</code> file. This file preserves the mempool so that when the node\nrestarts the mempool can be filled with transactions without waiting for new transactions\nto be created. This will also preserve any changes made to a transaction through\ncommands such as <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">prioritisetransaction</code> so that those changes will not be lost.</p>\n<h2 id=\"final-alert\">Final Alert</h2>\n<p>The Alert System was <a href=\"https://bitcoin.org/en/alert/2016-11-01-alert-retirement\">disabled and deprecated</a> in Bitcoin Core 0.12.1 and removed in 0.13.0. \nThe Alert System was retired with a maximum sequence final alert which causes any nodes\nsupporting the Alert System to display a static hard-coded \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlert Key Compromised\u00e2\u0080\u009d message which also\nprevents any other alerts from overriding it. This final alert is hard-coded into this release\nso that all old nodes receive the final alert.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gui-changes\">GUI Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>After resetting the options by clicking the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Reset Options</code> button \nin the options dialog or with the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-resetguioptions</code> startup option, \nthe user will be prompted to choose the data directory again. This \nis to ensure that custom data directories will be kept after the \noption reset which clears the custom data directory set via the choose \ndatadir dialog.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Multiple peers can now be selected in the list of peers in the debug \nwindow. This allows for users to ban or disconnect multiple peers \nsimultaneously instead of banning them one at a time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>An indicator has been added to the bottom right hand corner of the main\nwindow to indicate whether the wallet being used is a HD wallet. This\nicon will be grayed out with an X on top of it if the wallet is not a\nHD wallet.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"low-level-rpc-changes\">Low-level RPC changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">importprunedfunds</code> only accepts two required arguments. Some versions accept\nan optional third arg, which was always ignored. Make sure to never pass more\nthan two arguments.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The first boolean argument to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getaddednodeinfo</code> has been removed. This is \nan incompatible change.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>RPC command <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getmininginfo</code> loses the \u00e2\u0080\u009ctestnet\u00e2\u0080\u009d field in favor of the more\ngeneric \u00e2\u0080\u009cchain\u00e2\u0080\u009d (which has been present for years).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A new RPC command <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">preciousblock</code> has been added which marks a block as\nprecious. A precious block will be treated as if it were received earlier\nthan a competing block.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A new RPC command <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">importmulti</code> has been added which receives an array of \nJSON objects representing the intention of importing a public key, a \nprivate key, an address and script/p2sh</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getrawtransaction</code> for retrieving confirmed transactions with unspent\noutputs has been deprecated. For now this will still work, but in the future\nit may change to only be able to retrieve information about transactions in\nthe mempool or if <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">txindex</code> is enabled.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A new RPC command <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getmemoryinfo</code> has been added which will return information\nabout the memory usage of Bitcoin Core. This was added in conjunction with\noptimizations to memory management. See Pull <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8753\">#8753</a>\nfor more information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A new RPC command <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bumpfee</code> has been added which allows replacing an\nunconfirmed wallet transaction that signaled RBF (see the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-walletrbf</code>\nstartup option above) with a new transaction that pays a higher fee, and\nshould be more likely to get confirmed quickly.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"http-rest-changes\">HTTP REST Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>UTXO set query (<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">GET /rest/getutxos/&lt;checkmempool&gt;/&lt;txid&gt;-&lt;n&gt;/&lt;txid&gt;-&lt;n&gt;\n/.../&lt;txid&gt;-&lt;n&gt;.&lt;bin|hex|json&gt;</code>) responses were changed to return status \ncode <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">HTTP_BAD_REQUEST</code> (400) instead of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR</code> (500)\nwhen requests contain invalid parameters.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"minimum-fee-rate-policies\">Minimum Fee Rate Policies</h2>\n<p>Since the changes in 0.12 to automatically limit the size of the mempool and improve the performance of block creation in mining code it has not been important for relay nodes or miners to set <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-minrelaytxfee</code>. With this release the following concepts that were tied to this option have been separated out:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>incremental relay fee used for calculating BIP 125 replacement and mempool limiting. (1000 satoshis/kB)</li>\n<li>calculation of threshold for a dust output. (effectively 3 * 1000 satoshis/kB)</li>\n<li>minimum fee rate of a package of transactions to be included in a block created by the mining code.

The RPC calls are deprecated and will either\nreturn -1 or 1e24 appropriately. The format for <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">fee_estimates.dat</code> has also\nchanged to no longer save these priority estimates. It will automatically be\nconverted to the new format which is not readable by prior versions of the\nsoftware.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Support for \u00e2\u0080\u009cpriority\u00e2\u0080\u009d (coin age) transaction sorting for mining is\nconsidered deprecated in Core and will be removed in the next major version.\nThis is not to be confused with the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">prioritisetransaction</code> RPC which will remain\nsupported by Core for adding fee deltas to transactions.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"p2p-connection-management\">P2P connection management</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Peers manually added through the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-addnode</code> option or <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">addnode</code> RPC now have their own\nlimit of eight connections which does not compete with other inbound or outbound\nconnection usage and is not subject to the limitation imposed by the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-maxconnections</code>\noption.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>New connections to manually added peers are performed more quickly.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"introduction-of-assumed-valid-blocks\">Introduction of assumed-valid blocks</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A significant portion of the initial block download time is spent verifying\nscripts/signatures.  Although the verification must pass to ensure the security\nof the system, no other result from this verification is needed: If the node\nknew the history of a given block were valid it could skip checking scripts\nfor its ancestors.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A new configuration option \u00e2\u0080\u0098assumevalid\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is provided to express this knowledge\nto the software.  Unlike the \u00e2\u0080\u0098checkpoints\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in the past this setting does not\nforce the use of a particular chain: chains that are consistent with it are\nprocessed quicker, but other chains are still accepted if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d otherwise\nbe chosen as best. Also unlike \u00e2\u0080\u0098checkpoints\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the user can configure which\nblock history is assumed true, this means that even outdated software can\nsync more quickly if the setting is updated by the user.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Because the validity of a chain history is a simple objective fact it is much\neasier to review this setting.  As a result the software ships with a default\nvalue adjusted to match the current chain shortly before release.  The use\nof this default value can be disabled by setting -assumevalid=0</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"fundrawtransaction-change-address-reuse\">Fundrawtransaction change address reuse</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Before 0.14, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">fundrawtransaction</code> was by default wallet stateless.

This means that not even critical security updates will be released anymore. Without security updates, using a bitcoin wallet on a XP machine is irresponsible at least.\nIn addition to that, with 0.12.x there have been varied reports of Bitcoin Core randomly crashing on Windows XP. It is not clear what the source of these crashes is, but it is likely that upstream libraries such as Qt are no longer being tested on XP.\nWe do not have time nor resources to provide support for an OS that is end-of-life. From 0.13.0 on, Windows XP is no longer supported. Users are suggested to upgrade to a newer version of Windows, or install an alternative OS\nthat is supported.\nNo attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP, you can still do so at your own risk, but do not expect it to work: do not report issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.\nFrom 0.13.1 onwards OS X 10.7 is no longer supported. 0.13.0 was intended to work on 10.7+, but severe issues with the libc++ version on 10.7.x keep it from running reliably. 0.13.1 now requires 10.8+, and will communicate that to 10.7 users, rather than crashing unexpectedly.\nNotable changes\nChange to wallet handling of mempool rejection\nWhen a newly created transaction failed to enter the mempool due to the limits on chains of unconfirmed transactions the sending RPC calls would return an error.  The transaction would still be queued in the wallet and, once some of the parent transactions were confirmed, broadcast after the software was restarted.\nThis behavior has been changed to return success and to reattempt mempool insertion at the same time transaction rebroadcast is attempted, avoiding a need for a restart.\nTransactions in the wallet which cannot be accepted into the mempool can be abandoned with the previously existing abandontransaction RPC (or in the GUI via a context menu on the transaction).\n0.13.2 Change log\nDetailed release notes follow. This overview includes changes that affect behavior, not code moves, refactors and string updates.

This means that not even critical security\nupdates will be released anymore. Without security updates, using a bitcoin\nwallet on a XP machine is irresponsible at least.\nIn addition to that, with 0.12.x there have been varied reports of Bitcoin Core\nrandomly crashing on Windows XP. It is not clear\nwhat the source of these crashes is, but it is likely that upstream\nlibraries such as Qt are no longer being tested on XP.\nWe do not have time nor resources to provide support for an OS that is\nend-of-life. From 0.13.0 on, Windows XP is no longer supported. Users are\nsuggested to upgrade to a newer version of Windows, or install an alternative OS\nthat is supported.\nNo attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP,\nyou can still do so at your own risk, but do not expect it to work: do not\nreport issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.\nFrom 0.13.1 onwards OS X 10.7 is no longer supported. 0.13.0 was intended to work on 10.7+, \nbut severe issues with the libc++ version on 10.7.x keep it from running reliably. \n0.13.1 now requires 10.8+, and will communicate that to 10.7 users, rather than crashing unexpectedly.\nNotable changes\nSegregated witness soft fork\nSegregated witness (segwit) is a soft fork that, if activated, will\nallow transaction-producing software to separate (segregate) transaction\nsignatures (witnesses) from the part of the data in a transaction that is\ncovered by the txid. This provides several immediate benefits:\n\n\nElimination of unwanted transaction malleability: Segregating the witness\nallows both existing and upgraded software to calculate the transaction\nidentifier (txid) of transactions without referencing the witness, which can\nsometimes be changed by third-parties (such as miners) or by co-signers in a\nmultisig spend. This solves all known cases of unwanted transaction\nmalleability, which is a problem that makes programming Bitcoin wallet\nsoftware more difficult and which seriously complicates the design of smart\ncontracts for Bitcoin.\n\n\nCapacity increase: Segwit transactions contain new fields that are not\npart of the data currently used to calculate the size of a block, which\nallows a block containing segwit transactions to hold more data than allowed\nby the current maximum block size. Estimates based on the transactions\ncurrently found in blocks indicate that if all wallets switch to using\nsegwit, the network will be able to support about 70% more transactions. The\nnetwork will also be able to support more of the advanced-style payments\n(such as multisig) than it can support now because of the different weighting\ngiven to different parts of a transaction after segwit activates (see the\nfollowing section for details).\n\n\nWeighting data based on how it affects node performance: Some parts of\neach Bitcoin block need to be stored by nodes in order to validate future\nblocks; other parts of a block can be immediately forgotten (pruned) or used\nonly for helping other nodes sync their copy of the block chain.  One large\npart of the immediately prunable data are transaction signatures (witnesses),\nand segwit makes it possible to give a different \u00e2\u0080\u009cweight\u00e2\u0080\u009d to segregated\nwitnesses to correspond with the lower demands they place on node resources.\nSpecifically, each byte of a segregated witness is given a weight of 1, each\nother byte in a block is given a weight of 4, and the maximum allowed weight\nof a block is 4 million.  Weighting the data this way better aligns the most\nprofitable strategy for creating blocks with the long-term costs of block\nvalidation.\n\n\nSignature covers value: A simple improvement in the way signatures are\ngenerated in segwit simplifies the design of secure signature generators\n(such as hardware wallets), reduces the amount of data the signature\ngenerator needs to download, and allows the signature generator to operate\nmore quickly.  This is made possible by having the generator sign the amount\nof bitcoins they think they are spending, and by having full nodes refuse to\naccept those signatures unless the amount of bitcoins being spent is exactly\nthe same as was signed.  For non-segwit transactions, wallets instead had to\ndownload the complete previous transactions being spent for every payment\nthey made, which could be a slow operation on hardware wallets and in other\nsituations where bandwidth or computation speed was constrained.\n\n\nLinear scaling of sighash operations: In 2015 a block was produced that\nrequired about 25 seconds to validate on modern hardware because of the way\ntransaction signature hashes are performed.  Other similar blocks, or blocks\nthat could take even longer to validate, can still be produced today.  The\nproblem that caused this can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be fixed in a soft fork without unwanted\nside-effects, but transactions that opt-in to using segwit will now use a\ndifferent signature method that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t suffer from this problem and doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nhave any unwanted side-effects.\n\n\nIncreased security for multisig: Bitcoin addresses (both P2PKH addresses\nthat start with a \u00e2\u0080\u00981\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and P2SH addresses that start with a \u00e2\u0080\u00983\u00e2\u0080\u0099) use a hash\nfunction known as RIPEMD-160.  For P2PKH addresses, this provides about 160\nbits of security\u00e2\u0080\u0094which is beyond what cryptographers believe can be broken\ntoday.  But because P2SH is more flexible, only about 80 bits of security is\nprovided per address. Although 80 bits is very strong security, it is within\nthe realm of possibility that it can be broken by a powerful adversary.\nSegwit allows advanced transactions to use the SHA256 hash function instead,\nwhich provides about 128 bits of security  (that is 281 trillion times as\nmuch security as 80 bits and is equivalent to the maximum bits of security\nbelieved to be provided by Bitcoin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s choice of parameters for its Elliptic\nCurve Digital Security Algorithm [ECDSA].)\n\n\nMore efficient almost-full-node security Satoshi Nakamoto\u00e2\u0080\u0099s original\nBitcoin paper describes a method for allowing newly-started full nodes to\nskip downloading and validating some data from historic blocks that are\nprotected by large amounts of proof of work.  Unfortunately, Nakamoto\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nmethod can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t guarantee that a newly-started node using this method will\nproduce an accurate copy of Bitcoin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current ledger (called the UTXO set),\nmaking the node vulnerable to falling out of consensus with other nodes.\nAlthough the problems with Nakamoto\u00e2\u0080\u0099s method can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be fixed in a soft fork,\nSegwit accomplishes something similar to his original proposal: it makes it\npossible for a node to optionally skip downloading some blockchain data\n(specifically, the segregated witnesses) while still ensuring that the node\ncan build an accurate copy of the UTXO set for the block chain with the most\nproof of work.  Segwit enables this capability at the consensus layer, but\nnote that Bitcoin Core does not provide an option to use this capability as\nof this 0.13.1 release.\n\n\nScript versioning: Segwit makes it easy for future soft forks to allow\nBitcoin users to individually opt-in to almost any change in the Bitcoin\nScript language when those users receive new transactions.  Features\ncurrently being researched by Bitcoin Core contributors that may use this\ncapability include support for Schnorr signatures, which can improve the\nprivacy and efficiency of multisig transactions (or transactions with\nmultiple inputs), and Merklized Abstract Syntax Trees (MAST), which can\nimprove the privacy and efficiency of scripts with two or more conditions.\nOther Bitcoin community members are studying several other improvements\nthat can be made using script versioning.\n\n\nActivation for the segwit soft fork is being managed using BIP9\nversionbits.  Segwit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s version bit is bit 1, and nodes will begin\ntracking which blocks signal support for segwit at the beginning of the\nfirst retarget period after segwit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s start date of 15 November 2016.  If\n95% of blocks within a 2,016-block retarget period (about two weeks)\nsignal support for segwit, the soft fork will be locked in.  After\nanother 2,016 blocks, segwit will activate.\nFor more information about segwit, please see the segwit FAQ, the\nsegwit wallet developers guide or BIPs 141, 143,\n144, and 145.  If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a miner or mining pool\noperator, please see the versionbits FAQ for information about\nsignaling support for a soft fork.\nNull dummy soft fork\nCombined with the segwit soft fork is an additional change that turns a\nlong-existing network relay policy into a consensus rule. The\nOP_CHECKMULTISIG and OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY opcodes consume an extra\nstack element (\u00e2\u0080\u009cdummy element\u00e2\u0080\u009d) after signature validation. The dummy\nelement is not inspected in any manner, and could be replaced by any\nvalue without invalidating the script.\nBecause any value can be used for this dummy element, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible for\na third-party to insert data into other people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s transactions, changing\nthe transaction\u00e2\u0080\u0099s txid (called transaction malleability) and possibly\ncausing other problems.\nSince Bitcoin Core 0.10.0, nodes have defaulted to only relaying and\nmining transactions whose dummy element was a null value (0x00, also\ncalled OP_0).  The null dummy soft fork turns this relay rule into a\nconsensus rule both for non-segwit transactions and segwit transactions,\nso that this method of mutating transactions is permanently eliminated\nfrom the network.\nSignaling for the null dummy soft fork is done by signaling support\nfor segwit, and the null dummy soft fork will activate at the same time\nas segwit.\nFor more information, please see BIP147.\nLow-level RPC changes\n\nimportprunedfunds only accepts two required arguments. Some versions accept\nan optional third arg, which was always ignored. Make sure to never pass more\nthan two arguments.\n\nLinux ARM builds\nWith the 0.13.0 release, pre-built Linux ARM binaries were added to the set of\nuploaded executables. Additional detail on the ARM architecture targeted by each\nis provided below.\nThe following extra files can be found in the download directory or torrent:\n\nbitcoin-${VERSION}-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz: Linux binaries targeting\nthe 32-bit ARMv7-A architecture.\nbitcoin-${VERSION}-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz: Linux binaries targeting\nthe 64-bit ARMv8-A architecture.\n\nARM builds are still experimental. If you have problems on a certain device or\nLinux distribution combination please report them on the bug tracker, it may be\npossible to resolve them. Note that the device you use must be (backward)\ncompatible with the architecture targeted by the binary that you use.\nFor example, a Raspberry Pi 2 Model B or Raspberry Pi 3 Model B (in its 32-bit\nexecution state) device, can run the 32-bit ARMv7-A targeted binary. However,\nno model of Raspberry Pi 1 device can run either binary because they are all\nARMv6 architecture devices that are not compatible with ARMv7-A or ARMv8-A.\nNote that Android is not considered ARM Linux in this context. The executables\nare not expected to work out of the box on Android.\n0.13.1 Change log\nDetailed release notes follow.

This means that not even critical security\nupdates will be released anymore. Without security updates, using a bitcoin\nwallet on a XP machine is irresponsible at least.</p>\n<p>In addition to that, with 0.12.x there have been varied reports of Bitcoin Core\nrandomly crashing on Windows XP. It is <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/7681#issuecomment-217439891\">not clear</a>\nwhat the source of these crashes is, but it is likely that upstream\nlibraries such as Qt are no longer being tested on XP.</p>\n<p>We do not have time nor resources to provide support for an OS that is\nend-of-life. From 0.13.0 on, Windows XP is no longer supported. Users are\nsuggested to upgrade to a newer version of Windows, or install an alternative OS\nthat is supported.</p>\n<p>No attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP,\nyou can still do so at your own risk, but do not expect it to work: do not\nreport issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.</p>\n<p>From 0.13.1 onwards OS X 10.7 is no longer supported. 0.13.0 was intended to work on 10.7+, \nbut severe issues with the libc++ version on 10.7.x keep it from running reliably. \n0.13.1 now requires 10.8+, and will communicate that to 10.7 users, rather than crashing unexpectedly.</p>\n<h1 id=\"notable-changes\">Notable changes</h1>\n<h2 id=\"segregated-witness-soft-fork\">Segregated witness soft fork</h2>\n<p>Segregated witness (segwit) is a soft fork that, if activated, will\nallow transaction-producing software to separate (segregate) transaction\nsignatures (witnesses) from the part of the data in a transaction that is\ncovered by the txid. This provides several immediate benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Elimination of unwanted transaction malleability:</strong> Segregating the witness\nallows both existing and upgraded software to calculate the transaction\nidentifier (txid) of transactions without referencing the witness, which can\nsometimes be changed by third-parties (such as miners) or by co-signers in a\nmultisig spend. This solves all known cases of unwanted transaction\nmalleability, which is a problem that makes programming Bitcoin wallet\nsoftware more difficult and which seriously complicates the design of smart\ncontracts for Bitcoin.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Capacity increase:</strong> Segwit transactions contain new fields that are not\npart of the data currently used to calculate the size of a block, which\nallows a block containing segwit transactions to hold more data than allowed\nby the current maximum block size. Estimates based on the transactions\ncurrently found in blocks indicate that if all wallets switch to using\nsegwit, the network will be able to support about 70% more transactions. The\nnetwork will also be able to support more of the advanced-style payments\n(such as multisig) than it can support now because of the different weighting\ngiven to different parts of a transaction after segwit activates (see the\nfollowing section for details).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Weighting data based on how it affects node performance:</strong> Some parts of\neach Bitcoin block need to be stored by nodes in order to validate future\nblocks; other parts of a block can be immediately forgotten (pruned) or used\nonly for helping other nodes sync their copy of the block chain.  One large\npart of the immediately prunable data are transaction signatures (witnesses),\nand segwit makes it possible to give a different \u00e2\u0080\u009cweight\u00e2\u0080\u009d to segregated\nwitnesses to correspond with the lower demands they place on node resources.\nSpecifically, each byte of a segregated witness is given a weight of 1, each\nother byte in a block is given a weight of 4, and the maximum allowed weight\nof a block is 4 million.  Weighting the data this way better aligns the most\nprofitable strategy for creating blocks with the long-term costs of block\nvalidation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Signature covers value:</strong> A simple improvement in the way signatures are\ngenerated in segwit simplifies the design of secure signature generators\n(such as hardware wallets), reduces the amount of data the signature\ngenerator needs to download, and allows the signature generator to operate\nmore quickly.  This is made possible by having the generator sign the amount\nof bitcoins they think they are spending, and by having full nodes refuse to\naccept those signatures unless the amount of bitcoins being spent is exactly\nthe same as was signed.  For non-segwit transactions, wallets instead had to\ndownload the complete previous transactions being spent for every payment\nthey made, which could be a slow operation on hardware wallets and in other\nsituations where bandwidth or computation speed was constrained.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Linear scaling of sighash operations:</strong> In 2015 a block was produced that\nrequired about 25 seconds to validate on modern hardware because of the way\ntransaction signature hashes are performed.  Other similar blocks, or blocks\nthat could take even longer to validate, can still be produced today.  The\nproblem that caused this can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be fixed in a soft fork without unwanted\nside-effects, but transactions that opt-in to using segwit will now use a\ndifferent signature method that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t suffer from this problem and doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nhave any unwanted side-effects.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Increased security for multisig:</strong> Bitcoin addresses (both P2PKH addresses\nthat start with a \u00e2\u0080\u00981\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and P2SH addresses that start with a \u00e2\u0080\u00983\u00e2\u0080\u0099) use a hash\nfunction known as RIPEMD-160.  For P2PKH addresses, this provides about 160\nbits of security\u00e2\u0080\u0094which is beyond what cryptographers believe can be broken\ntoday.  But because P2SH is more flexible, only about 80 bits of security is\nprovided per address. Although 80 bits is very strong security, it is within\nthe realm of possibility that it can be broken by a powerful adversary.\nSegwit allows advanced transactions to use the SHA256 hash function instead,\nwhich provides about 128 bits of security  (that is 281 trillion times as\nmuch security as 80 bits and is equivalent to the maximum bits of security\nbelieved to be provided by Bitcoin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s choice of parameters for its Elliptic\nCurve Digital Security Algorithm [ECDSA].)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>More efficient almost-full-node security</strong> Satoshi Nakamoto\u00e2\u0080\u0099s original\nBitcoin paper describes a method for allowing newly-started full nodes to\nskip downloading and validating some data from historic blocks that are\nprotected by large amounts of proof of work.  Unfortunately, Nakamoto\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nmethod can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t guarantee that a newly-started node using this method will\nproduce an accurate copy of Bitcoin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current ledger (called the UTXO set),\nmaking the node vulnerable to falling out of consensus with other nodes.\nAlthough the problems with Nakamoto\u00e2\u0080\u0099s method can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be fixed in a soft fork,\nSegwit accomplishes something similar to his original proposal: it makes it\npossible for a node to optionally skip downloading some blockchain data\n(specifically, the segregated witnesses) while still ensuring that the node\ncan build an accurate copy of the UTXO set for the block chain with the most\nproof of work.  Segwit enables this capability at the consensus layer, but\nnote that Bitcoin Core does not provide an option to use this capability as\nof this 0.13.1 release.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Script versioning:</strong> Segwit makes it easy for future soft forks to allow\nBitcoin users to individually opt-in to almost any change in the Bitcoin\nScript language when those users receive new transactions.  Features\ncurrently being researched by Bitcoin Core contributors that may use this\ncapability include support for Schnorr signatures, which can improve the\nprivacy and efficiency of multisig transactions (or transactions with\nmultiple inputs), and Merklized Abstract Syntax Trees (MAST), which can\nimprove the privacy and efficiency of scripts with two or more conditions.\nOther Bitcoin community members are studying several other improvements\nthat can be made using script versioning.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Activation for the segwit soft fork is being managed using BIP9\nversionbits.  Segwit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s version bit is bit 1, and nodes will begin\ntracking which blocks signal support for segwit at the beginning of the\nfirst retarget period after segwit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s start date of 15 November 2016.  If\n95% of blocks within a 2,016-block retarget period (about two weeks)\nsignal support for segwit, the soft fork will be locked in.  After\nanother 2,016 blocks, segwit will activate.</p>\n<p>For more information about segwit, please see the <a href=\"https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits/\">segwit FAQ</a>, the\n<a href=\"https://bitcoincore.org/en/segwit_wallet_dev/\">segwit wallet developers guide</a> or BIPs <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki\">141</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0143.mediawiki\">143</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0144.mediawiki\">144</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0145.mediawiki\">145</a>.

The\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">OP_CHECKMULTISIG</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY</code> opcodes consume an extra\nstack element (\u00e2\u0080\u009cdummy element\u00e2\u0080\u009d) after signature validation. The dummy\nelement is not inspected in any manner, and could be replaced by any\nvalue without invalidating the script.</p>\n<p>Because any value can be used for this dummy element, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible for\na third-party to insert data into other people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s transactions, changing\nthe transaction\u00e2\u0080\u0099s txid (called transaction malleability) and possibly\ncausing other problems.</p>\n<p>Since Bitcoin Core 0.10.0, nodes have defaulted to only relaying and\nmining transactions whose dummy element was a null value (0x00, also\ncalled OP_0).  The null dummy soft fork turns this relay rule into a\nconsensus rule both for non-segwit transactions and segwit transactions,\nso that this method of mutating transactions is permanently eliminated\nfrom the network.</p>\n<p>Signaling for the null dummy soft fork is done by signaling support\nfor segwit, and the null dummy soft fork will activate at the same time\nas segwit.</p>\n<p>For more information, please see <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0147.mediawiki\">BIP147</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"low-level-rpc-changes\">Low-level RPC changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">importprunedfunds</code> only accepts two required arguments.

This means that not even critical security\nupdates will be released anymore. Without security updates, using a bitcoin\nwallet on a XP machine is irresponsible at least.\nIn addition to that, with 0.12.x there have been varied reports of Bitcoin Core\nrandomly crashing on Windows XP. It is not clear\nwhat the source of these crashes is, but it is likely that upstream\nlibraries such as Qt are no longer being tested on XP.\nWe do not have time nor resources to provide support for an OS that is\nend-of-life. From 0.13.0 on, Windows XP is no longer supported. Users are\nsuggested to upgrade to a newer verion of Windows, or install an alternative OS\nthat is supported.\nNo attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP,\nyou can still do so at your own risk, but do not expect it to work: do not\nreport issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.\nNotable changes\nDatabase cache memory increased\nAs a result of growth of the UTXO set, performance with the prior default\ndatabase cache of 100 MiB has suffered.\nFor this reason the default was changed to 300 MiB in this release.\nFor nodes on low-memory systems, the database cache can be changed back to\n100 MiB (or to another value) by either:\n\nAdding dbcache=100 in bitcoin.conf\nChanging it in the GUI under Options \u00e2\u0086\u0092 Size of database cache\n\nNote that the database cache setting has the most performance impact\nduring initial sync of a node, and when catching up after downtime.\nbitcoin-cli: arguments privacy\nThe RPC command line client gained a new argument, -stdin\nto read extra arguments from standard input, one per line until EOF/Ctrl-D.\nFor example:\n$ src/bitcoin-cli -stdin walletpassphrase\nmysecretcode\n120\n..... press Ctrl-D here to end input\n$\n\nIt is recommended to use this for sensitive information such as wallet\npassphrases, as command-line arguments can usually be read from the process\ntable by any user on the system.\nC++11 and Python 3\nVarious code modernizations have been done. The Bitcoin Core code base has\nstarted using C++11. This means that a C++11-capable compiler is now needed for\nbuilding. Effectively this means GCC 4.7 or higher, or Clang 3.3 or higher.\nWhen cross-compiling for a target that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have C++11 libraries, configure with\n./configure --enable-glibc-back-compat ... LDFLAGS=-static-libstdc++.\nFor running the functional tests in qa/rpc-tests, Python3.4 or higher is now\nrequired.\nLinux ARM builds\nDue to popular request, Linux ARM builds have been added to the uploaded\nexecutables.\nThe following extra files can be found in the download directory or torrent:\n\nbitcoin-${VERSION}-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz: Linux binaries for the most\ncommon 32-bit ARM architecture.\nbitcoin-${VERSION}-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz: Linux binaries for the most\ncommon 64-bit ARM architecture.\n\nARM builds are still experimental. If you have problems on a certain device or\nLinux distribution combination please report them on the bug tracker, it may be\npossible to resolve them.\nNote that Android is not considered ARM Linux in this context. The executables\nare not expected to work out of the box on Android.\nCompact Block support (BIP 152)\nSupport for block relay using the Compact Blocks protocol has been implemented\nin PR 8068.\nThe primary goal is reducing the bandwidth spikes at relay time, though in many\ncases it also reduces propagation delay. It is automatically enabled between\ncompatible peers.\nBIP 152\nAs a side-effect, ordinary non-mining nodes will download and upload blocks\nfaster if those blocks were produced by miners using similar transaction\nfiltering policies. This means that a miner who produces a block with many\ntransactions discouraged by your node will be relayed slower than one with\nonly transactions already in your memory pool. The overall effect of such\nrelay differences on the network may result in blocks which include widely-\ndiscouraged transactions losing a stale block race, and therefore miners may\nwish to configure their node to take common relay policies into consideration.\nHierarchical Deterministic Key Generation\nNewly created wallets will use hierarchical deterministic key generation\naccording to BIP32 (keypath m/0\u00e2\u0080\u0099/0\u00e2\u0080\u0099/k\u00e2\u0080\u0099).\nExisting wallets will still use traditional key generation.\nBackups of HD wallets, regardless of when they have been created, can\ntherefore be used to re-generate all possible private keys, even the\nones which haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t already been generated during the time of the backup.\nAttention: Encrypting the wallet will create a new seed which requires\na new backup!\nWallet dumps (created using the dumpwallet RPC) will contain the deterministic\nseed. This is expected to allow future versions to import the seed and all\nassociated funds, but this is not yet implemented.\nHD key generation for new wallets can be disabled by -usehd=0. Keep in\nmind that this flag only has affect on newly created wallets.\nYou can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t disable HD key generation once you have created a HD wallet.\nThere is no distinction between internal (change) and external keys.\nHD wallets are incompatible with older versions of Bitcoin Core.\nPull request, BIP 32\nSegregated Witness\nThe code preparations for Segregated Witness (\u00e2\u0080\u009csegwit\u00e2\u0080\u009d), as described in BIP\n141, BIP\n143, BIP\n144, and BIP\n145 are\nfinished and included in this release.  However, BIP 141 does not yet specify\nactivation parameters on mainnet, and so this release does not support segwit\nuse on mainnet.  Testnet use is supported, and after BIP 141 is updated with\nproposed parameters, a future release of Bitcoin Core is expected that\nimplements those parameters for mainnet.\nFurthermore, because segwit activation is not yet specified for mainnet,\nversion 0.13.0 will behave similarly as other pre-segwit releases even after a\nfuture activation of BIP 141 on the network.  Upgrading from 0.13.0 will be\nrequired in order to utilize segwit-related features on mainnet (such as signal\nBIP 141 activation, mine segwit blocks, fully validate segwit blocks, relay\nsegwit blocks to other segwit nodes, and use segwit transactions in the\nwallet, etc).\nMining transaction selection (\u00e2\u0080\u009cChild Pays For Parent\u00e2\u0080\u009d)\nThe mining transaction selection algorithm has been replaced with an algorithm\nthat selects transactions based on their feerate inclusive of unconfirmed\nancestor transactions.  This means that a low-fee transaction can become more\nlikely to be selected if a high-fee transaction that spends its outputs is\nrelayed.\nWith this change, the -blockminsize command line option has been removed.\nThe command line option -blockmaxsize remains an option to specify the\nmaximum number of serialized bytes in a generated block.  In addition, the new\ncommand line option -blockmaxweight has been added, which specifies the\nmaximum \u00e2\u0080\u009cblock weight\u00e2\u0080\u009d of a generated block, as defined by [BIP 141 (Segregated\nWitness)] (https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki).\nIn preparation for Segregated Witness, the mining algorithm has been modified\nto optimize transaction selection for a given block weight, rather than a given\nnumber of serialized bytes in a block.  In this release, transaction selection\nis unaffected by this distinction (as BIP 141 activation is not supported on\nmainnet in this release, see above), but in future releases and after BIP 141\nactivation, these calculations would be expected to differ.\nFor optimal runtime performance, miners using this release should specify\n-blockmaxweight on the command line, and not specify -blockmaxsize.\nAdditionally (or only) specifying -blockmaxsize, or relying on default\nsettings for both, may result in performance degradation, as the logic to\nsupport -blockmaxsize performs additional computation to ensure that\nconstraint is met.  (Note that for mainnet, in this release, the equivalent\nparameter for -blockmaxweight would be four times the desired\n-blockmaxsize.  See [BIP 141]\n(https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki) for additional\ndetails.)\nIn the future, the -blockmaxsize option may be removed, as block creation is\nno longer optimized for this metric.  Feedback is requested on whether to\ndeprecate or keep this command line option in future releases.\nReindexing changes\nIn earlier versions, reindexing did validation while reading through the block\nfiles on disk. These two have now been split up, so that all blocks are known\nbefore validation starts. This was necessary to make certain optimizations that\nare available during normal synchronizations also available during reindexing.\nThe two phases are distinct in the Bitcoin-Qt GUI. During the first one,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cReindexing blocks on disk\u00e2\u0080\u009d is shown. During the second (slower) one,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cProcessing blocks on disk\u00e2\u0080\u009d is shown.\nIt is possible to only redo validation now, without rebuilding the block index,\nusing the command line option -reindex-chainstate (in addition to\n-reindex which does both). This new option is useful when the blocks on disk\nare assumed to be fine, but the chainstate is still corrupted. It is also\nuseful for benchmarks.\nRemoval of internal miner\nAs CPU mining has been useless for a long time, the internal miner has been\nremoved in this release, and replaced with a simpler implementation for the\ntest framework.\nThe overall result of this is that setgenerate RPC call has been removed, as\nwell as the -gen and -genproclimit command-line options.\nFor testing, the generate call can still be used to mine a block, and a new\nRPC call generatetoaddress has been added to mine to a specific address. This\nworks with wallet disabled.\nNew bytespersigop implementation\nThe former implementation of the bytespersigop filter accidentally broke bare\nmultisig (which is meant to be controlled by the permitbaremultisig option),\nsince the consensus protocol always counts these older transaction forms as 20\nsigops for backwards compatibility. Simply fixing this bug by counting more\naccurately would have reintroduced a vulnerability. It has therefore been\nreplaced with a new implementation that rather than filter such transactions,\ninstead treats them (for fee purposes only) as if they were in fact the size\nof a transaction actually using all 20 sigops.\nLow-level P2P changes\n\n\nThe optional new p2p message \u00e2\u0080\u009cfeefilter\u00e2\u0080\u009d is implemented and the protocol\nversion is bumped to 70013. Upon receiving a feefilter message from a peer,\na node will not send invs for any transactions which do not meet the filter\nfeerate. BIP 133\n\n\nThe P2P alert system has been removed in PR #7692 and the alert P2P message\nis no longer supported.\n\n\nThe transaction relay mechanism used to relay one quarter of all transactions\ninstantly, while queueing up the rest and sending them out in batch. As\nthis resulted in chains of dependent transactions being reordered, it\nsystematically hurt transaction relay. The relay code was redesigned in PRs\n<a href=\u00e2\u0080\u009dhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7840\u00e2\u0080\u009d>#7840</a> and #8082, and now always batches transactions announcements while also\nsorting them according to dependency order. This significantly reduces orphan\ntransactions. To compensate for the removal of instant relay, the frequency of\nbatch sending was doubled for outgoing peers.\n\n\nSince PR #7840 the BIP35 mempool command is also subject to batch processing.\nAlso the mempool message is no longer handled for non-whitelisted peers when\nNODE_BLOOM is disabled through -peerbloomfilters=0.\n\n\nThe maximum size of orphan transactions that are kept in memory until their\nancestors arrive has been raised in PR #8179 from 5000 to 99999 bytes. They\nare now also removed from memory when they are included in a block, conflict\nwith a block, and time out after 20 minutes.\n\n\nWe respond at most once to a getaddr request during the lifetime of a\nconnection since PR #7856.\n\n\nConnections to peers who have recently been the first one to give us a valid\nnew block or transaction are protected from disconnections since PR #8084.\n\n\nLow-level RPC changes\n\n\nRPC calls have been added to output detailed statistics for individual mempool\nentries, as well as to calculate the in-mempool ancestors or descendants of a\ntransaction: see getmempoolentry, getmempoolancestors, getmempooldescendants.\n\n\ngettxoutsetinfo UTXO hash (hash_serialized) has changed. There was a divergence between\n32-bit and 64-bit platforms, and the txids were missing in the hashed data. This has been\nfixed, but this means that the output will be different than from previous versions.\n\n\nFull UTF-8 support in the RPC API. Non-ASCII characters in, for example,\nwallet labels have always been malformed because they weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t taken into account\nproperly in JSON RPC processing. This is no longer the case. This also affects\nthe GUI debug console.\n\n\nAsm script outputs replacements for OP_NOP2 and OP_NOP3\n\n\nOP_NOP2 has been renamed to OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY by BIP \n65\n\n\nOP_NOP3 has been renamed to OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY by BIP \n112\n\n\nThe following outputs are affected by this change:\n\nRPC getrawtransaction (in verbose mode)\nRPC decoderawtransaction\nRPC decodescript\nREST /rest/tx/ (JSON format)\nREST /rest/block/ (JSON format when including extended tx details)\nbitcoin-tx -json\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sorting of the output of the getrawmempool output has changed.\n\n\nNew RPC commands: generatetoaddress, importprunedfunds, removeprunedfunds, signmessagewithprivkey,\ngetmempoolancestors, getmempooldescendants, getmempoolentry,\ncreatewitnessaddress, addwitnessaddress.\n\n\nRemoved RPC commands: setgenerate, getgenerate.\n\n\nNew options were added to fundrawtransaction: includeWatching, changeAddress, changePosition and feeRate.\n\n\nLow-level ZMQ changes\n\nEach ZMQ notification now contains an up-counting sequence number that allows\nlisteners to detect lost notifications.\nThe sequence number is always the last element in a multi-part ZMQ notification and\ntherefore backward compatible. Each message type has its own counter.\nPR #7762.\n\n0.13.0 Change log\nDetailed release notes follow. This overview includes changes that affect\nbehavior, not code moves, refactors and string updates. For convenience in locating\nthe code changes and accompanying discussion, both the pull request and\ngit merge commit are mentioned.\nRPC and other APIs\n\n#7156 9ee02cf Remove cs_main lock from

href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/end-of-xp-support\">April 8th, 2014</a>,\nan OS initially released in 2001. This means that not even critical security\nupdates will be released anymore. Without security updates, using a bitcoin\nwallet on a XP machine is irresponsible at least.</p>\n<p>In addition to that, with 0.12.x there have been varied reports of Bitcoin Core\nrandomly crashing on Windows XP. It is <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/7681#issuecomment-217439891\">not clear</a>\nwhat the source of these crashes is, but it is likely that upstream\nlibraries such as Qt are no longer being tested on XP.</p>\n<p>We do not have time nor resources to provide support for an OS that is\nend-of-life. From 0.13.0 on, Windows XP is no longer supported. Users are\nsuggested to upgrade to a newer verion of Windows, or install an alternative OS\nthat is supported.</p>\n<p>No attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP,\nyou can still do so at your own risk, but do not expect it to work: do not\nreport issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.</p>\n<h1 id=\"notable-changes\">Notable changes</h1>\n<h2 id=\"database-cache-memory-increased\">Database cache memory increased</h2>\n<p>As a result of growth of the UTXO set, performance with the prior default\ndatabase cache of 100 MiB has suffered.\nFor this reason the default was changed to 300 MiB in this release.</p>\n<p>For nodes on low-memory systems, the database cache can be changed back to\n100 MiB (or to another value) by either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adding <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">dbcache=100</code> in bitcoin.conf</li>\n<li>Changing it in the GUI under <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Options \u00e2\u0086\u0092 Size of database cache</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that the database cache setting has the most performance impact\nduring initial sync of a node, and when catching up after downtime.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bitcoin-cli-arguments-privacy\">bitcoin-cli: arguments privacy</h2>\n<p>The RPC command line client gained a new argument, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-stdin</code>\nto read extra arguments from standard input, one per line until EOF/Ctrl-D.\nFor example:</p>\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>$ src/bitcoin-cli -stdin walletpassphrase\nmysecretcode\n120\n..... press Ctrl-D here to end input\n$\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>It is recommended to use this for sensitive information such as wallet\npassphrases, as command-line arguments can usually be read from the process\ntable by any user on the system.</p>\n<h2 id=\"c11-and-python-3\">C++11 and Python 3</h2>\n<p>Various code modernizations have been done. The Bitcoin Core code base has\nstarted using C++11. This means that a C++11-capable compiler is now needed for\nbuilding. Effectively this means GCC 4.7 or higher, or Clang 3.3 or higher.</p>\n<p>When cross-compiling for a target that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have C++11 libraries, configure with\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">./configure --enable-glibc-back-compat ... LDFLAGS=-static-libstdc++</code>.</p>\n<p>For running the functional tests in <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">qa/rpc-tests</code>, Python3.4 or higher is now\nrequired.</p>\n<h2 id=\"linux-arm-builds\">Linux ARM builds</h2>\n<p>Due to popular request, Linux ARM builds have been added to the uploaded\nexecutables.</p>\n<p>The following extra files can be found in the download directory or torrent:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin-${VERSION}-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz</code>: Linux binaries for the most\ncommon 32-bit ARM architecture.</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin-${VERSION}-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz</code>: Linux binaries for the most\ncommon 64-bit ARM architecture.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>ARM builds are still experimental. If you have problems on a certain device or\nLinux distribution combination please report them on the bug tracker, it may be\npossible to resolve them.</p>\n<p>Note that Android is not considered ARM Linux in this context. The executables\nare not expected to work out of the box on Android.</p>\n<h2 id=\"compact-block-support-bip-152\">Compact Block support (BIP 152)</h2>\n<p>Support for block relay using the Compact Blocks protocol has been implemented\nin PR 8068.</p>\n<p>The primary goal is reducing the bandwidth spikes at relay time, though in many\ncases it also reduces propagation delay. It is automatically enabled between\ncompatible peers.\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0152.mediawiki\">BIP 152</a></p>\n<p>As a side-effect, ordinary non-mining nodes will download and upload blocks\nfaster if those blocks were produced by miners using similar transaction\nfiltering policies. This means that a miner who produces a block with many\ntransactions discouraged by your node will be relayed slower than one with\nonly transactions already in your memory pool. The overall effect of such\nrelay differences on the network may result in blocks which include widely-\ndiscouraged transactions losing a stale block race, and therefore miners may\nwish to configure their node to take common relay policies into consideration.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hierarchical-deterministic-key-generation\">Hierarchical Deterministic Key Generation</h2>\n<p>Newly created wallets will use hierarchical deterministic key generation\naccording to BIP32 (keypath m/0\u00e2\u0080\u0099/0\u00e2\u0080\u0099/k\u00e2\u0080\u0099).\nExisting wallets will still use traditional key generation.</p>\n<p>Backups of HD wallets, regardless of when they have been created, can\ntherefore be used to re-generate all possible private keys, even the\nones which haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t already been generated during the time of the backup.\n<strong>Attention:</strong> Encrypting the wallet will create a new seed which requires\na new backup!</p>\n<p>Wallet dumps (created using the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">dumpwallet</code> RPC) will contain the deterministic\nseed. This is expected to allow future versions to import the seed and all\nassociated funds, but this is not yet implemented.</p>\n<p>HD key generation for new wallets can be disabled by <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-usehd=0</code>. Keep in\nmind that this flag only has affect on newly created wallets.\nYou can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t disable HD key generation once you have created a HD wallet.</p>\n<p>There is no distinction between internal (change) and external keys.</p>\n<p>HD wallets are incompatible with older versions of Bitcoin Core.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8035/files\">Pull request</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki\">BIP 32</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"segregated-witness\">Segregated Witness</h2>\n<p>The code preparations for Segregated Witness (\u00e2\u0080\u009csegwit\u00e2\u0080\u009d), as described in <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki\">BIP\n141</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0143.mediawiki\">BIP\n143</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0144.mediawiki\">BIP\n144</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0145.mediawiki\">BIP\n145</a> are\nfinished and included in this release.  However, BIP 141 does not yet specify\nactivation parameters on mainnet, and so this release does not support segwit\nuse on mainnet.  Testnet use is supported, and after BIP 141 is updated with\nproposed parameters, a future release of Bitcoin Core is expected that\nimplements those parameters for mainnet.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, because segwit activation is not yet specified for mainnet,\nversion 0.13.0 will behave similarly as other pre-segwit releases even after a\nfuture activation of BIP 141 on the network.  Upgrading from 0.13.0 will be\nrequired in order to utilize segwit-related features on mainnet (such as signal\nBIP 141 activation, mine segwit blocks, fully validate segwit blocks, relay\nsegwit blocks to other segwit nodes, and use segwit transactions in the\nwallet, etc).</p>\n<h2 id=\"mining-transaction-selection-child-pays-for-parent\">Mining transaction selection (\u00e2\u0080\u009cChild Pays For Parent\u00e2\u0080\u009d)</h2>\n<p>The mining transaction selection algorithm has been replaced with an algorithm\nthat selects transactions based on their feerate inclusive of unconfirmed\nancestor transactions.  This means that a low-fee transaction can become more\nlikely to be selected if a high-fee transaction that spends its outputs is\nrelayed.</p>\n<p>With this change, the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-blockminsize</code> command line option has been removed.</p>\n<p>The command line option <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-blockmaxsize</code> remains an option to specify the\nmaximum number of serialized bytes in a generated block.  In addition, the new\ncommand line option <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-blockmaxweight</code> has been added, which specifies the\nmaximum \u00e2\u0080\u009cblock weight\u00e2\u0080\u009d of a generated block, as defined by [BIP 141 (Segregated\nWitness)] (https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki).</p>\n<p>In preparation for Segregated Witness, the mining algorithm has been modified\nto optimize transaction selection for a given block weight, rather than a given\nnumber of serialized bytes in a block.  In this release, transaction selection\nis unaffected by this distinction (as BIP 141 activation is not supported on\nmainnet in this release, see above), but in future releases and after BIP 141\nactivation, these calculations would be expected to differ.</p>\n<p>For optimal runtime performance, miners using this release should specify\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-blockmaxweight</code> on the command line, and not specify <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-blockmaxsize</code>.\nAdditionally (or only) specifying <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-blockmaxsize</code>, or relying on default\nsettings for both, may result in performance degradation, as the logic to\nsupport <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-blockmaxsize</code> performs additional computation to ensure that\nconstraint is met.  (Note that for mainnet, in this release, the equivalent\nparameter for <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-blockmaxweight</code> would be four times the desired\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-blockmaxsize</code>.  See [BIP 141]\n(https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki) for additional\ndetails.)</p>\n<p>In the future, the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-blockmaxsize</code> option may be removed, as block creation is\nno longer optimized for this metric.  Feedback is requested on whether to\ndeprecate or keep this command line option in future releases.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reindexing-changes\">Reindexing changes</h2>\n<p>In earlier versions, reindexing did validation while reading through the block\nfiles on disk. These two have now been split up, so that all blocks are known\nbefore validation starts. This was necessary to make certain optimizations that\nare available during normal synchronizations also available during reindexing.</p>\n<p>The two phases are distinct in the Bitcoin-Qt GUI. During the first one,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cReindexing blocks on disk\u00e2\u0080\u009d is shown. During the second (slower) one,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cProcessing blocks on disk\u00e2\u0080\u009d is shown.</p>\n<p>It is possible to only redo validation now, without rebuilding the block index,\nusing the command line option <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-reindex-chainstate</code> (in addition to\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-reindex</code> which does both). This new option is useful when the blocks on disk\nare assumed to be fine, but the chainstate is still corrupted. It is also\nuseful for benchmarks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"removal-of-internal-miner\">Removal of internal miner</h2>\n<p>As CPU mining has been useless for a long time, the internal miner has been\nremoved in this release, and replaced with a simpler implementation for the\ntest framework.</p>\n<p>The overall result of this is that <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">setgenerate</code> RPC call has been removed, as\nwell as the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-gen</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-genproclimit</code> command-line options.</p>\n<p>For testing, the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">generate</code> call can still be used to mine a block, and a new\nRPC call <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">generatetoaddress</code> has been added to mine to a specific address. This\nworks with wallet disabled.</p>\n<h2 id=\"new-bytespersigop-implementation\">New bytespersigop implementation</h2>\n<p>The former implementation of the bytespersigop filter accidentally broke bare\nmultisig (which is meant to be controlled by the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">permitbaremultisig</code> option),\nsince the consensus protocol always counts these older transaction forms as 20\nsigops for backwards compatibility. Simply fixing this bug by counting more\naccurately would have reintroduced a vulnerability. It has therefore been\nreplaced with a new implementation that rather than filter such transactions,\ninstead treats them (for fee purposes only) as if they were in fact the size\nof a transaction actually using all 20 sigops.</p>\n<h2 id=\"low-level-p2p-changes\">Low-level P2P changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The optional new p2p message \u00e2\u0080\u009cfeefilter\u00e2\u0080\u009d is implemented and the protocol\nversion is bumped to 70013. Upon receiving a feefilter message from a peer,\na node will not send invs for any transactions which do not meet the filter\nfeerate. <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0133.mediawiki\">BIP 133</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The P2P alert system has been removed in PR <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7692\">#7692</a> and the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">alert</code> P2P message\nis no longer supported.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The transaction relay mechanism used to relay one quarter of all transactions\ninstantly, while queueing up the rest and sending them out in batch. As\nthis resulted in chains of dependent transactions being reordered, it\nsystematically hurt transaction relay. The relay code was redesigned in PRs\n&lt;a href=\u00e2\u0080\u009dhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7840\u00e2\u0080\u009d&gt;#7840&lt;/a&gt; and <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8082\">#8082</a>, and now always batches transactions announcements while also\nsorting them according to dependency order. This significantly reduces orphan\ntransactions. To compensate for the removal of instant relay, the frequency of\nbatch sending was doubled for outgoing peers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Since PR <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7840\">#7840</a> the BIP35 <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">mempool</code> command is also subject to batch processing.\nAlso the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">mempool</code> message is no longer handled for non-whitelisted peers when\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">NODE_BLOOM</code> is disabled through <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-peerbloomfilters=0</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The maximum size of orphan transactions that are kept in memory until their\nancestors arrive has been raised in PR <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8179\">#8179</a> from 5000 to 99999 bytes. They\nare now also removed from memory when they are included in a block, conflict\nwith a block, and time out after 20 minutes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We respond at most once to a getaddr request during the lifetime of a\nconnection since PR <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7856\">#7856</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Connections to peers who have recently been the first one to give us a valid\nnew block or transaction are protected from disconnections since PR <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8084\">#8084</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"low-level-rpc-changes\">Low-level RPC changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>RPC calls have been added to output detailed statistics for individual mempool\nentries, as well as to calculate the in-mempool ancestors or descendants of a\ntransaction: see <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getmempoolentry</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getmempoolancestors</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getmempooldescendants</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">gettxoutsetinfo</code> UTXO hash (<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">hash_serialized</code>) has changed.

Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or\nbitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).\nDowngrade warning\nDowngrade to a version < 0.12.0\nBecause release 0.12.0 and later will obfuscate the chainstate on every\nfresh sync or reindex, the chainstate is not backwards-compatible with\npre-0.12 versions of Bitcoin Core or other software.\nIf you want to downgrade after you have done a reindex with 0.12.0 or later,\nyou will need to reindex when you first start Bitcoin Core version 0.11 or\nearlier.\nNotable changes\nFirst version bits BIP9 softfork deployment\nThis release includes a soft fork deployment to enforce BIP68,\nBIP112 and BIP113 using the BIP9 deployment mechanism.\nThe deployment sets the block version number to 0x20000001 between\nmidnight 1st May 2016 and midnight 1st May 2017 to signal readiness for \ndeployment. The version number consists of 0x20000000 to indicate version\nbits together with setting bit 0 to indicate support for this combined\ndeployment, shown as \u00e2\u0080\u009ccsv\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the getblockchaininfo RPC call.\nFor more information about the soft forking change, please see\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7648\nThis specific backport pull-request can be viewed at\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7543\nBIP68 soft fork to enforce sequence locks for relative locktime\nBIP68 introduces relative lock-time consensus-enforced semantics of\nthe sequence number field to enable a signed transaction input to remain\ninvalid for a defined period of time after confirmation of its corresponding\noutpoint.\nFor more information about the implementation, see\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7184\nBIP112 soft fork to enforce OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY\nBIP112 redefines the existing OP_NOP3 as OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY (CSV)\nfor a new opcode in the Bitcoin scripting system that in combination with\nBIP68 allows execution pathways of a script to be restricted based\non the age of the output being spent.\nFor more information about the implementation, see\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7524\nBIP113 locktime enforcement soft fork\nBitcoin Core 0.11.2 previously introduced mempool-only locktime\nenforcement using GetMedianTimePast(). This release seeks to\nconsensus enforce the rule.\nBitcoin transactions currently may specify a locktime indicating when\nthey may be added to a valid block.  Current consensus rules require\nthat blocks have a block header time greater than the locktime specified\nin any transaction in that block.\nMiners get to choose what time they use for their header time, with the\nconsensus rule being that no node will accept a block whose time is more\nthan two hours in the future.  This creates a incentive for miners to\nset their header times to future values in order to include locktimed\ntransactions which weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t supposed to be included for up to two more\nhours.\nThe consensus rules also specify that valid blocks may have a header\ntime greater than that of the median of the 11 previous blocks.  This\nGetMedianTimePast() time has a key feature we generally associate with\ntime: it can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go backwards.\nBIP113 specifies a soft fork enforced in this release that\nweakens this perverse incentive for individual miners to use a future\ntime by requiring that valid blocks have a computed GetMedianTimePast()\ngreater than the locktime specified in any transaction in that block.\nMempool inclusion rules currently require transactions to be valid for\nimmediate inclusion in a block in order to be accepted into the mempool.\nThis release begins applying the BIP113 rule to received transactions,\nso transaction whose time is greater than the GetMedianTimePast() will\nno longer be accepted into the mempool.\nImplication for miners: you will begin rejecting transactions that\nwould not be valid under BIP113, which will prevent you from producing\ninvalid blocks when BIP113 is enforced on the network. Any\ntransactions which are valid under the current rules but not yet valid\nunder the BIP113 rules will either be mined by other miners or delayed\nuntil they are valid under BIP113. Note, however, that time-based\nlocktime transactions are more or less unseen on the network currently.\nImplication for users: GetMedianTimePast() always trails behind the\ncurrent time, so a transaction locktime set to the present time will be\nrejected by nodes running this release until the median time moves\nforward. To compensate, subtract one hour (3,600 seconds) from your\nlocktimes to allow those transactions to be included in mempools at\napproximately the expected time.\nFor more information about the implementation, see\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6566\nMiscellaneous\nThe p2p alert system is off by default. To turn on, use -alert with\nstartup configuration.\n0.12.1 Change log\nDetailed release notes follow.

This release seeks to\nconsensus enforce the rule.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin transactions currently may specify a locktime indicating when\nthey may be added to a valid block.  Current consensus rules require\nthat blocks have a block header time greater than the locktime specified\nin any transaction in that block.</p>\n<p>Miners get to choose what time they use for their header time, with the\nconsensus rule being that no node will accept a block whose time is more\nthan two hours in the future.  This creates a incentive for miners to\nset their header times to future values in order to include locktimed\ntransactions which weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t supposed to be included for up to two more\nhours.</p>\n<p>The consensus rules also specify that valid blocks may have a header\ntime greater than that of the median of the 11 previous blocks.  This\nGetMedianTimePast() time has a key feature we generally associate with\ntime: it can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go backwards.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0113.mediawiki\">BIP113</a> specifies a soft fork enforced in this release that\nweakens this perverse incentive for individual miners to use a future\ntime by requiring that valid blocks have a computed GetMedianTimePast()\ngreater than the locktime specified in any transaction in that block.</p>\n<p>Mempool inclusion rules currently require transactions to be valid for\nimmediate inclusion in a block in order to be accepted into the mempool.\nThis release begins applying the BIP113 rule to received transactions,\nso transaction whose time is greater than the GetMedianTimePast() will\nno longer be accepted into the mempool.</p>\n<p><strong>Implication for miners:</strong> you will begin rejecting transactions that\nwould not be valid under BIP113, which will prevent you from producing\ninvalid blocks when BIP113 is enforced on the network. Any\ntransactions which are valid under the current rules but not yet valid\nunder the BIP113 rules will either be mined by other miners or delayed\nuntil they are valid under BIP113. Note, however, that time-based\nlocktime transactions are more or less unseen on the network currently.</p>\n<p><strong>Implication for users:</strong> GetMedianTimePast() always trails behind the\ncurrent time, so a transaction locktime set to the present time will be\nrejected by nodes running this release until the median time moves\nforward. To compensate, subtract one hour (3,600 seconds) from your\nlocktimes to allow those transactions to be included in mempools at\napproximately the expected time.</p>\n<p>For more information about the implementation, see\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6566\">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6566</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"miscellaneous\">Miscellaneous</h2>\n<p>The p2p alert system is off by default.

Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).\nDowngrade warning\nDowngrade to a version < 0.10.0\nBecause release 0.10.0 and later makes use of headers-first synchronization and parallel block download (see further), the block files and databases are not backwards-compatible with pre-0.10 versions of Bitcoin Core or other software:\n\n\nBlocks will be stored on disk out of order (in the order they are received, really), which makes it incompatible with some tools or other programs. Reindexing using earlier versions will also not work anymore as a result of this.\n\n\nThe block index database will now hold headers for which no block is stored on disk, which earlier versions won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t support.\n\n\nIf you want to be able to downgrade smoothly, make a backup of your entire data directory. Without this your node will need start syncing (or importing from bootstrap.dat) anew afterwards. It is possible that the data from a completely synchronised 0.10 node may be usable in older versions as-is, but this is not supported and may break as soon as the older version attempts to reindex.\nThis does not affect wallet forward or backward compatibility.\nDowngrade to a version < 0.12.0\nBecause release 0.12.0 and later will obfuscate the chainstate on every fresh sync or reindex, the chainstate is not backwards-compatible with pre-0.12 versions of Bitcoin Core or other software.\nIf you want to downgrade after you have done a reindex with 0.12.0 or later, you will need to reindex when you first start Bitcoin Core version 0.11 or earlier.\nNotable changes\nSignature validation using libsecp256k1\nECDSA signatures inside Bitcoin transactions now use validation using libsecp256k1 instead of OpenSSL.\nDepending on the platform, this means a significant speedup for raw signature validation speed. The advantage is largest on x86_64, where validation is over five times faster. In practice, this translates to a raw reindexing and new block validation times that are less than half of what it was before.\nLibsecp256k1 has undergone very extensive testing and validation.\nA side effect of this change is that libconsensus no longer depends on OpenSSL.\nReduce upload traffic\nA major part of the outbound traffic is caused by serving historic blocks to other nodes in initial block download state.\nIt is now possible to reduce the total upload traffic via the -maxuploadtarget parameter. This is not a hard limit but a threshold to minimize the outbound traffic. When the limit is about to be reached, the uploaded data is cut by not serving historic blocks (blocks older than one week).\nMoreover, any SPV peer is disconnected when they request a filtered block.\nThis option can be specified in MiB per day and is turned off by default (-maxuploadtarget=0).\nThe recommended minimum is 144 * MAX_BLOCK_SIZE (currently 144MB) per day.\nWhitelisted peers will never be disconnected, although their traffic counts for calculating the target.\nA more detailed documentation about keeping traffic low can be found in /doc/reduce-traffic.md.\nDirect headers announcement (BIP 130)\nBetween compatible peers, BIP 130 direct headers announcement is used. This means that blocks are advertised by announcing their headers directly, instead of just announcing the hash. In a reorganization, all new headers are sent, instead of just the new tip. This can often prevent an extra roundtrip before the actual block is downloaded.\nWith this change, pruning nodes are now able to relay new blocks to compatible peers.\nMemory pool limiting\nPrevious versions of Bitcoin Core had their mempool limited by checking a transaction\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fees against the node\u00e2\u0080\u0099s minimum relay fee. There was no upper bound on the size of the mempool and attackers could send a large number of transactions paying just slighly more than the default minimum relay fee to crash nodes with relatively low RAM. A temporary workaround for previous versions of Bitcoin Core was to raise the default minimum relay fee.\nBitcoin Core 0.12 will have a strict maximum size on the mempool. The default value is 300 MB and can be configured with the -maxmempool parameter. Whenever a transaction would cause the mempool to exceed its maximum size, the transaction that (along with in-mempool descendants) has the lowest total feerate (as a package) will be evicted and the node\u00e2\u0080\u0099s effective minimum relay feerate will be increased to match this feerate plus the initial minimum relay feerate. The initial minimum relay feerate is set to 1000 satoshis per kB.\nBitcoin Core 0.12 also introduces new default policy limits on the length and size of unconfirmed transaction chains that are allowed in the mempool (generally limiting the length of unconfirmed chains to 25 transactions, with a total size of 101 KB).  These limits can be overriden using command line arguments; see the extended help (--help -help-debug) for more information.\nOpt-in Replace-by-fee transactions\nIt is now possible to replace transactions in the transaction memory pool of Bitcoin Core 0.12 nodes. Bitcoin Core will only allow replacement of transactions which have any of their inputs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 nSequence number set to less than 0xffffffff - 1.  Moreover, a replacement transaction may only be accepted when it pays sufficient fee, as described in BIP 125.\nTransaction replacement can be disabled with a new command line option, -mempoolreplacement=0.  Transactions signaling replacement under BIP125 will still be allowed into the mempool in this configuration, but replacements will be rejected.  This option is intended for miners who want to continue the transaction selection behavior of previous releases.\nThe -mempoolreplacement option is not recommended for wallet users seeking to avoid receipt of unconfirmed opt-in transactions, because this option does not prevent transactions which are replaceable under BIP 125 from being accepted (only subsequent replacements, which other nodes on the network that implement BIP 125 are likely to relay and mine).\nWallet users wishing to detect whether a transaction is subject to replacement under BIP 125 should instead use the updated RPC calls gettransaction and listtransactions, which now have an additional field in the output indicating if a transaction is replaceable under BIP125 (\u00e2\u0080\u009cbip125-replaceable\u00e2\u0080\u009d).\nNote that the wallet in Bitcoin Core 0.12 does not yet have support for creating transactions that would be replaceable under BIP 125.\nRPC: Random-cookie RPC authentication\nWhen no -rpcpassword is specified, the daemon now uses a special \u00e2\u0080\u0098cookie\u00e2\u0080\u0099 file for authentication. This file is generated with random content when the daemon starts, and deleted when it exits. Its contents are used as authentication token. Read access to this file controls who can access through RPC. By default it is stored in the data directory but its location can be overridden with the option -rpccookiefile.\nThis is similar to Tor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CookieAuthentication: see https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en\nThis allows running bitcoind without having to do any manual configuration.\nRelay: Any sequence of pushdatas in OP_RETURN outputs now allowed\nPreviously OP_RETURN outputs with a payload were only relayed and mined if they had a single pushdata. This restriction has been lifted to allow any combination of data pushes and numeric constant opcodes (OP_1 to OP_16) after the OP_RETURN. The limit on OP_RETURN output size is now applied to the entire serialized scriptPubKey, 83 bytes by default. (the previous 80 byte default plus three bytes overhead)\nRelay and Mining: Priority transactions\nBitcoin Core has a heuristic \u00e2\u0080\u0098priority\u00e2\u0080\u0099 based on coin value and age.\nThis calculation is used for relaying of transactions which do not pay the minimum relay fee, and can be used as an alternative way of sorting transactions for mined blocks.\nBitcoin Core will relay transactions with insufficient fees depending on the setting of -limitfreerelay=<r> (default: r=15 kB per minute) and -blockprioritysize=<s>.\nIn Bitcoin Core 0.12, when mempool limit has been reached a higher minimum relay fee takes effect to limit memory usage. Transactions which do not meet this higher effective minimum relay fee will not be relayed or mined even if they rank highly according to the priority heuristic.\nThe mining of transactions based on their priority is also now disabled by default. To re-enable it, simply set -blockprioritysize=<n> where is the size in bytes of your blocks to reserve for these transactions.\nThe old default was 50k, so to retain approximately the same policy, you would set -blockprioritysize=50000.\nAdditionally, as a result of computational simplifications, the priority value used for transactions received with unconfirmed inputs is lower than in prior versions due to avoiding recomputing the amounts as input transactions confirm.\nExternal miner policy set via the prioritisetransaction RPC to rank transactions already in the mempool continues to work as it has previously.\nNote, however, that if mining priority transactions is left disabled, the priority delta will be ignored and only the fee metric will be effective.\nThis internal automatic prioritization handling is being considered for removal entirely in Bitcoin Core 0.13, and it is at this time undecided whether the more accurate priority calculation for chained unconfirmed transactions will be restored.\nCommunity direction on this topic is particularly requested to help set project priorities.\nAutomatically use Tor hidden services\nStarting with Tor version 0.2.7.1 it is possible, through Tor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s control socket API, to create and destroy \u00e2\u0080\u0098ephemeral\u00e2\u0080\u0099 hidden services programmatically.\nBitcoin Core has been updated to make use of this.\nThis means that if Tor is running (and proper authorization is available), Bitcoin Core automatically creates a hidden service to listen on, without manual configuration.\nBitcoin Core will also use Tor automatically to connect to other .onion nodes if the control socket can be successfully opened.\nThis will positively affect the number of available .onion nodes and their usage.\nThis new feature is enabled by default if Bitcoin Core is listening, and a connection to Tor can be made. It can be configured with the -listenonion, -torcontrol and -torpassword settings. To show verbose debugging information, pass -debug=tor.\nNotifications through ZMQ\nBitcoind can now (optionally) asynchronously notify clients through a ZMQ-based PUB socket of the arrival of new transactions and blocks.\nThis feature requires installation of the ZMQ C API library 4.x and configuring its use through the command line or configuration file.\nPlease see docs/zmq.md for details of operation.\nWallet: Transaction fees\nVarious improvements have been made to how the wallet calculates transaction fees.\nUsers can decide to pay a predefined fee rate by setting -paytxfee=<n> (or settxfee <n> rpc during runtime). A value of n=0 signals Bitcoin Core to use floating fees. By default, Bitcoin Core will use floating fees.\nBased on past transaction data, floating fees approximate the fees required to get into the mth block from now. This is configurable with -txconfirmtarget=<m> (default: 2).\nSometimes, it is not possible to give good estimates, or an estimate at all. Therefore, a fallback value can be set with -fallbackfee=<f> (default: 0.0002 BTC/kB).\nAt all times, Bitcoin Core will cap fees at -maxtxfee=<x> (default: 0.10) BTC.\nFurthermore, Bitcoin Core will never create transactions paying less than the current minimum relay fee.\nFinally, a user can set the minimum fee rate for all transactions with -mintxfee=<i>, which defaults to 1000 satoshis per kB.\nWallet: Negative confirmations and conflict detection\nThe wallet will now report a negative number for confirmations that indicates how deep in the block chain the conflict is found. For example, if a transaction A has 5 confirmations and spends the same input as a wallet transaction B, B will be reported as having -5 confirmations. If another wallet transaction C spends an output from B, it will also be reported as having -5 confirmations.\nTo detect conflicts with historical transactions in the chain a one-time -rescan may be needed.\nUnlike earlier versions, unconfirmed but non-conflicting transactions will never get a negative confirmation count. They are not treated as spendable unless they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re coming from ourself (change) and accepted into our local mempool, however. The new \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrusted\u00e2\u0080\u009d field in the listtransactions RPC output indicates whether outputs of an unconfirmed transaction are considered spendable.\nWallet: Merkle branches removed\nPreviously, every wallet transaction stored a Merkle branch to prove its presence in blocks. This wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t being used for more than an expensive sanity check. Since 0.12, these are no longer stored. When loading a 0.12 wallet into an older version, it will automatically rescan to avoid failed checks.\nWallet: Pruning\nWith 0.12 it is possible to use wallet functionality in pruned mode.\nThis can reduce the disk usage from currently around 60 GB to around 2 GB.\nHowever, rescans as well as the RPCs importwallet, importaddress, importprivkey are disabled.\nTo enable block pruning set prune=<N> on the command line or in bitcoin.conf, where N is the number of MiB to allot for raw block & undo data.\nA value of 0 disables pruning. The minimal value above 0 is 550.\nYour wallet is as secure with high values as it is with low ones.\nHigher values merely ensure that your node will not shut down upon blockchain reorganizations of more than 2 days - which are unlikely to happen in practice.\nIn future releases, a higher value may also help the network as a whole: stored blocks could be served to other nodes.\nFor further information about pruning, you may also consult the release notes of v0.11.0.\nNODE_BLOOM service bit\nSupport for the NODE_BLOOM service bit, as described in BIP 111, has been added to the P2P protocol code.\nBIP 111 defines a service bit to allow peers to advertise that they support bloom filters (such as used by SPV clients) explicitly. It also bumps the protocol version to allow peers to identify old nodes which allow bloom filtering of the connection despite lacking the new service bit.\nIn this version, it is only enforced for peers that send protocol versions >=70011. For the next major version it is planned that this restriction will be removed. It is recommended to update SPV clients to check for the NODE_BLOOM service bit for nodes that report versions newer than 70011.\nOption parsing behavior\nCommand line options are now parsed strictly in the order in which they are specified. It used to be the case that -X -noX ends up, unintuitively, with X set, as -X had precedence over -noX. This is no longer the case. Like for other software, the last specified value for an option will hold.\nRPC: Low-level API changes\n\n\nMonetary amounts can be provided as strings. This means that for example the argument to sendtoaddress can be \u00e2\u0080\u009c0.0001\u00e2\u0080\u009d instead of 0.0001. This can be an advantage if a JSON library insists on using a lossy floating point type for numbers, which would be dangerous for monetary amounts.\n\n\nThe asm property of each scriptSig now contains the decoded signature hash type for each signature that provides a valid defined hash type.\n\n\nOP_NOP2 has been renamed to OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY by BIP 65\n\n\nThe following items contain assembly representations of scriptSig signatures and are affected by this change:\n\nRPC getrawtransaction\nRPC decoderawtransaction\nRPC decodescript\nREST /rest/tx/ (JSON format)\nREST /rest/block/ (JSON format when including extended tx details)\nbitcoin-tx -json\n\nFor example, the scriptSig.asm property of a transaction input that previously showed an assembly representation of:\n304502207fa7a6d1e0ee81132a269ad84e68d695483745cde8b541e3bf630749894e342a022100c1f7ab20e13e22fb95281a870f3dcf38d782e53023ee313d741ad0cfbc0c509001 400000 OP_NOP2\n\nnow shows as:\n304502207fa7a6d1e0ee81132a269ad84e68d695483745cde8b541e3bf630749894e342a022100c1f7ab20e13e22fb95281a870f3dcf38d782e53023ee313d741ad0cfbc0c5090[ALL] 400000 OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY\n\nNote that the output of the RPC decodescript did not change because it is configured specifically to process scriptPubKey and not scriptSig scripts.\nRPC: SSL support dropped\nSSL support for RPC, previously enabled by the option rpcssl has been dropped from both the client and the server. This was done in preparation for removing the dependency on OpenSSL for the daemon completely.\nTrying to use rpcssl will result in an error:\nError: SSL mode for RPC (-rpcssl) is no longer supported.\n\nIf you are one of the few people that relies on this feature, a flexible migration path is to use stunnel. This is an utility that can tunnel arbitrary TCP connections inside SSL. On e.g. Ubuntu it can be installed with:\nsudo apt-get install stunnel4\n\nThen, to tunnel a SSL connection on 28332 to a RPC server bound on localhost on port 18332 do:\nstunnel -d 28332 -r 127.0.0.1:18332 -p stunnel.pem -P ''\n\nIt can also be set up system-wide in inetd style.\nAnother way to re-attain SSL would be to setup a httpd reverse proxy. This solution would allow the use of different authentication, loadbalancing, on-the-fly compression and caching. A sample config for apache2 could look like:\nListen 443\n\nNameVirtualHost *:443\n<VirtualHost *:443>\n\nSSLEngine On\nSSLCertificateFile /etc/apache2/ssl/server.crt\nSSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/apache2/ssl/server.key\n\n<Location /bitcoinrpc>\n    ProxyPass http://127.0.0.1:8332/\n    ProxyPassReverse http://127.0.0.1:8332/\n    # optional enable digest auth\n    # AuthType Digest\n    # ...\n\n    # optional bypass bitcoind rpc basic auth\n    # RequestHeader set Authorization \"Basic <hash>\"\n    # get the <hash> from the shell with: base64 <<< bitcoinrpc:<password>\n</Location>\n\n# Or, balance the load:\n# ProxyPass / balancer://balancer_cluster_name\n\n</VirtualHost>\n\nMining Code Changes\nThe mining code in 0.12 has been optimized to be significantly faster and use less memory. As part of these changes, consensus critical calculations are cached on a transaction\u00e2\u0080\u0099s acceptance into the mempool and the mining code now relies on the consistency of the mempool to assemble blocks. However all blocks are still tested for validity after assembly.\nOther P2P Changes\nThe list of banned peers is now stored on disk rather than in memory. Restarting bitcoind will no longer clear out the list of banned peers; instead a new RPC call (clearbanned) can be used to manually clear the list.  The new setban RPC call can also be used to manually ban or unban a peer.\n0.12.0 Change log\nDetailed release notes follow.

Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).</p>\n<h2 id=\"downgrade-warning\">Downgrade warning</h2>\n<h3 id=\"downgrade-to-a-version--0100\">Downgrade to a version &lt; 0.10.0</h3>\n<p>Because release 0.10.0 and later makes use of headers-first synchronization and parallel block download (see further), the block files and databases are not backwards-compatible with pre-0.10 versions of Bitcoin Core or other software:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Blocks will be stored on disk out of order (in the order they are received, really), which makes it incompatible with some tools or other programs. Reindexing using earlier versions will also not work anymore as a result of this.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The block index database will now hold headers for which no block is stored on disk, which earlier versions won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t support.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want to be able to downgrade smoothly, make a backup of your entire data directory. Without this your node will need start syncing (or importing from bootstrap.dat) anew afterwards. It is possible that the data from a completely synchronised 0.10 node may be usable in older versions as-is, but this is not supported and may break as soon as the older version attempts to reindex.</p>\n<p>This does not affect wallet forward or backward compatibility.</p>\n<h3 id=\"downgrade-to-a-version--0120\">Downgrade to a version &lt; 0.12.0</h3>\n<p>Because release 0.12.0 and later will obfuscate the chainstate on every fresh sync or reindex, the chainstate is not backwards-compatible with pre-0.12 versions of Bitcoin Core or other software.</p>\n<p>If you want to downgrade after you have done a reindex with 0.12.0 or later, you will need to reindex when you first start Bitcoin Core version 0.11 or earlier.</p>\n<h1 id=\"notable-changes\">Notable changes</h1>\n<h2 id=\"signature-validation-using-libsecp256k1\">Signature validation using libsecp256k1</h2>\n<p>ECDSA signatures inside Bitcoin transactions now use validation using <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/secp256k1\">libsecp256k1</a> instead of OpenSSL.</p>\n<p>Depending on the platform, this means a significant speedup for raw signature validation speed. The advantage is largest on x86_64, where validation is over five times faster. In practice, this translates to a raw reindexing and new block validation times that are less than half of what it was before.</p>\n<p>Libsecp256k1 has undergone very extensive testing and validation.</p>\n<p>A side effect of this change is that libconsensus no longer depends on OpenSSL.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reduce-upload-traffic\">Reduce upload traffic</h2>\n<p>A major part of the outbound traffic is caused by serving historic blocks to other nodes in initial block download state.</p>\n<p>It is now possible to reduce the total upload traffic via the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-maxuploadtarget</code> parameter. This is <em>not</em> a hard limit but a threshold to minimize the outbound traffic. When the limit is about to be reached, the uploaded data is cut by not serving historic blocks (blocks older than one week).\nMoreover, any SPV peer is disconnected when they request a filtered block.</p>\n<p>This option can be specified in MiB per day and is turned off by default (<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-maxuploadtarget=0</code>).\nThe recommended minimum is 144 * MAX_BLOCK_SIZE (currently 144MB) per day.</p>\n<p>Whitelisted peers will never be disconnected, although their traffic counts for calculating the target.</p>\n<p>A more detailed documentation about keeping traffic low can be found in <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.12.0/doc/reduce-traffic.md\">/doc/reduce-traffic.md</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"direct-headers-announcement-bip-130\">Direct headers announcement (BIP 130)</h2>\n<p>Between compatible peers, <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0130.mediawiki\">BIP 130</a> direct headers announcement is used. This means that blocks are advertised by announcing their headers directly, instead of just announcing the hash. In a reorganization, all new headers are sent, instead of just the new tip. This can often prevent an extra roundtrip before the actual block is downloaded.</p>\n<p>With this change, pruning nodes are now able to relay new blocks to compatible peers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"memory-pool-limiting\">Memory pool limiting</h2>\n<p>Previous versions of Bitcoin Core had their mempool limited by checking a transaction\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fees against the node\u00e2\u0080\u0099s minimum relay fee. There was no upper bound on the size of the mempool and attackers could send a large number of transactions paying just slighly more than the default minimum relay fee to crash nodes with relatively low RAM. A temporary workaround for previous versions of Bitcoin Core was to raise the default minimum relay fee.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin Core 0.12 will have a strict maximum size on the mempool. The default value is 300 MB and can be configured with the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-maxmempool</code> parameter. Whenever a transaction would cause the mempool to exceed its maximum size, the transaction that (along with in-mempool descendants) has the lowest total feerate (as a package) will be evicted and the node\u00e2\u0080\u0099s effective minimum relay feerate will be increased to match this feerate plus the initial minimum relay feerate. The initial minimum relay feerate is set to 1000 satoshis per kB.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin Core 0.12 also introduces new default policy limits on the length and size of unconfirmed transaction chains that are allowed in the mempool (generally limiting the length of unconfirmed chains to 25 transactions, with a total size of 101 KB).  These limits can be overriden using command line arguments; see the extended help (<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">--help -help-debug</code>) for more information.</p>\n<h2 id=\"opt-in-replace-by-fee-transactions\">Opt-in Replace-by-fee transactions</h2>\n<p>It is now possible to replace transactions in the transaction memory pool of Bitcoin Core 0.12 nodes. Bitcoin Core will only allow replacement of transactions which have any of their inputs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">nSequence</code> number set to less than <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">0xffffffff - 1</code>.  Moreover, a replacement transaction may only be accepted when it pays sufficient fee, as described in <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki\">BIP 125</a>.</p>\n<p>Transaction replacement can be disabled with a new command line option, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-mempoolreplacement=0</code>.  Transactions signaling replacement under BIP125 will still be allowed into the mempool in this configuration, but replacements will be rejected.  This option is intended for miners who want to continue the transaction selection behavior of previous releases.</p>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-mempoolreplacement</code> option is <em>not recommended</em> for wallet users seeking to avoid receipt of unconfirmed opt-in transactions, because this option does not prevent transactions which are replaceable under BIP 125 from being accepted (only subsequent replacements, which other nodes on the network that implement BIP 125 are likely to relay and mine).\nWallet users wishing to detect whether a transaction is subject to replacement under BIP 125 should instead use the updated RPC calls <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">gettransaction</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">listtransactions</code>, which now have an additional field in the output indicating if a transaction is replaceable under BIP125 (\u00e2\u0080\u009cbip125-replaceable\u00e2\u0080\u009d).</p>\n<p>Note that the wallet in Bitcoin Core 0.12 does not yet have support for creating transactions that would be replaceable under BIP 125.</p>\n<h2 id=\"rpc-random-cookie-rpc-authentication\">RPC: Random-cookie RPC authentication</h2>\n<p>When no <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-rpcpassword</code> is specified, the daemon now uses a special \u00e2\u0080\u0098cookie\u00e2\u0080\u0099 file for authentication. This file is generated with random content when the daemon starts, and deleted when it exits. Its contents are used as authentication token. Read access to this file controls who can access through RPC. By default it is stored in the data directory but its location can be overridden with the option <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-rpccookiefile</code>.</p>\n<p>This is similar to Tor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CookieAuthentication: see <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en\">https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en</a></p>\n<p>This allows running bitcoind without having to do any manual configuration.</p>\n<h2 id=\"relay-any-sequence-of-pushdatas-in-op_return-outputs-now-allowed\">Relay: Any sequence of pushdatas in OP_RETURN outputs now allowed</h2>\n<p>Previously OP_RETURN outputs with a payload were only relayed and mined if they had a single pushdata. This restriction has been lifted to allow any combination of data pushes and numeric constant opcodes (OP_1 to OP_16) after the OP_RETURN. The limit on OP_RETURN output size is now applied to the entire serialized scriptPubKey, 83 bytes by default. (the previous 80 byte default plus three bytes overhead)</p>\n<h2 id=\"relay-and-mining-priority-transactions\">Relay and Mining: Priority transactions</h2>\n<p>Bitcoin Core has a heuristic \u00e2\u0080\u0098priority\u00e2\u0080\u0099 based on coin value and age.\nThis calculation is used for relaying of transactions which do not pay the minimum relay fee, and can be used as an alternative way of sorting transactions for mined blocks.\nBitcoin Core will relay transactions with insufficient fees depending on the setting of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-limitfreerelay=&lt;r&gt;</code> (default: <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">r=15</code> kB per minute) and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-blockprioritysize=&lt;s&gt;</code>.</p>\n<p>In Bitcoin Core 0.12, when mempool limit has been reached a higher minimum relay fee takes effect to limit memory usage. Transactions which do not meet this higher effective minimum relay fee will not be relayed or mined even if they rank highly according to the priority heuristic.</p>\n<p>The mining of transactions based on their priority is also now disabled by default. To re-enable it, simply set <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-blockprioritysize=&lt;n&gt;</code> where is the size in bytes of your blocks to reserve for these transactions.\nThe old default was 50k, so to retain approximately the same policy, you would set <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-blockprioritysize=50000</code>.</p>\n<p>Additionally, as a result of computational simplifications, the priority value used for transactions received with unconfirmed inputs is lower than in prior versions due to avoiding recomputing the amounts as input transactions confirm.</p>\n<p>External miner policy set via the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">prioritisetransaction</code> RPC to rank transactions already in the mempool continues to work as it has previously.\nNote, however, that if mining priority transactions is left disabled, the priority delta will be ignored and only the fee metric will be effective.</p>\n<p>This internal automatic prioritization handling is being considered for removal entirely in Bitcoin Core 0.13, and it is at this time undecided whether the more accurate priority calculation for chained unconfirmed transactions will be restored.\nCommunity direction on this topic is particularly requested to help set project priorities.</p>\n<h2 id=\"automatically-use-tor-hidden-services\">Automatically use Tor hidden services</h2>\n<p>Starting with Tor version 0.2.7.1 it is possible, through Tor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s control socket API, to create and destroy \u00e2\u0080\u0098ephemeral\u00e2\u0080\u0099 hidden services programmatically.\nBitcoin Core has been updated to make use of this.</p>\n<p>This means that if Tor is running (and proper authorization is available), Bitcoin Core automatically creates a hidden service to listen on, without manual configuration.\nBitcoin Core will also use Tor automatically to connect to other .onion nodes if the control socket can be successfully opened.\nThis will positively affect the number of available .onion nodes and their usage.</p>\n<p>This new feature is enabled by default if Bitcoin Core is listening, and a connection to Tor can be made. It can be configured with the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-listenonion</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-torcontrol</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-torpassword</code> settings. To show verbose debugging information, pass <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-debug=tor</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"notifications-through-zmq\">Notifications through ZMQ</h2>\n<p>Bitcoind can now (optionally) asynchronously notify clients through a ZMQ-based PUB socket of the arrival of new transactions and blocks.\nThis feature requires installation of the ZMQ C API library 4.x and configuring its use through the command line or configuration file.\nPlease see <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.12.0/doc/zmq.md\">docs/zmq.md</a> for details of operation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wallet-transaction-fees\">Wallet: Transaction fees</h2>\n<p>Various improvements have been made to how the wallet calculates transaction fees.</p>\n<p>Users can decide to pay a predefined fee rate by setting <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-paytxfee=&lt;n&gt;</code> (or <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">settxfee &lt;n&gt;</code> rpc during runtime). A value of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">n=0</code> signals Bitcoin Core to use floating fees. By default, Bitcoin Core will use floating fees.</p>\n<p>Based on past transaction data, floating fees approximate the fees required to get into the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">m</code>th block from now. This is configurable with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-txconfirmtarget=&lt;m&gt;</code> (default: <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">2</code>).</p>\n<p>Sometimes, it is not possible to give good estimates, or an estimate at all. Therefore, a fallback value can be set with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-fallbackfee=&lt;f&gt;</code> (default: <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">0.0002</code> BTC/kB).</p>\n<p>At all times, Bitcoin Core will cap fees at <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-maxtxfee=&lt;x&gt;</code> (default: 0.10) BTC.\nFurthermore, Bitcoin Core will never create transactions paying less than the current minimum relay fee.\nFinally, a user can set the minimum fee rate for all transactions with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-mintxfee=&lt;i&gt;</code>, which defaults to 1000 satoshis per kB.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wallet-negative-confirmations-and-conflict-detection\">Wallet: Negative confirmations and conflict detection</h2>\n<p>The wallet will now report a negative number for confirmations that indicates how deep in the block chain the conflict is found. For example, if a transaction A has 5 confirmations and spends the same input as a wallet transaction B, B will be reported as having -5 confirmations. If another wallet transaction C spends an output from B, it will also be reported as having -5 confirmations.\nTo detect conflicts with historical transactions in the chain a one-time <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-rescan</code> may be needed.</p>\n<p>Unlike earlier versions, unconfirmed but non-conflicting transactions will never get a negative confirmation count. They are not treated as spendable unless they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re coming from ourself (change) and accepted into our local mempool, however. The new \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrusted\u00e2\u0080\u009d field in the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">listtransactions</code> RPC output indicates whether outputs of an unconfirmed transaction are considered spendable.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wallet-merkle-branches-removed\">Wallet: Merkle branches removed</h2>\n<p>Previously, every wallet transaction stored a Merkle branch to prove its presence in blocks. This wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t being used for more than an expensive sanity check. Since 0.12, these are no longer stored. When loading a 0.12 wallet into an older version, it will automatically rescan to avoid failed checks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wallet-pruning\">Wallet: Pruning</h2>\n<p>With 0.12 it is possible to use wallet functionality in pruned mode.\nThis can reduce the disk usage from currently around 60 GB to around 2 GB.</p>\n<p>However, rescans as well as the RPCs <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">importwallet</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">importaddress</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">importprivkey</code> are disabled.</p>\n<p>To enable block pruning set <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">prune=&lt;N&gt;</code> on the command line or in <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin.conf</code>, where <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">N</code> is the number of MiB to allot for raw block &amp; undo data.</p>\n<p>A value of 0 disables pruning. The minimal value above 0 is 550.\nYour wallet is as secure with high values as it is with low ones.\nHigher values merely ensure that your node will not shut down upon blockchain reorganizations of more than 2 days - which are unlikely to happen in practice.\nIn future releases, a higher value may also help the network as a whole: stored blocks could be served to other nodes.</p>\n<p>For further information about pruning, you may also consult the <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.11.0/doc/release-notes.md#block-file-pruning\">release notes of v0.11.0</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"node_bloom-service-bit\"><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">NODE_BLOOM</code> service bit</h2>\n<p>Support for the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">NODE_BLOOM</code> service bit, as described in <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0111.mediawiki\">BIP 111</a>, has been added to the P2P protocol code.</p>\n<p>BIP 111 defines a service bit to allow peers to advertise that they support bloom filters (such as used by SPV clients) explicitly. It also bumps the protocol version to allow peers to identify old nodes which allow bloom filtering of the connection despite lacking the new service bit.</p>\n<p>In this version, it is only enforced for peers that send protocol versions <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">&gt;=70011</code>. For the next major version it is planned that this restriction will be removed. It is recommended to update SPV clients to check for the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">NODE_BLOOM</code> service bit for nodes that report versions newer than 70011.</p>\n<h2 id=\"option-parsing-behavior\">Option parsing behavior</h2>\n<p>Command line options are now parsed strictly in the order in which they are specified. It used to be the case that <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-X -noX</code> ends up, unintuitively, with X set, as <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-X</code> had precedence over <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-noX</code>. This is no longer the case. Like for other software, the last specified value for an option will hold.</p>\n<h2 id=\"rpc-low-level-api-changes\">RPC: Low-level API changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Monetary amounts can be provided as strings. This means that for example the argument to sendtoaddress can be \u00e2\u0080\u009c0.0001\u00e2\u0080\u009d instead of 0.0001. This can be an advantage if a JSON library insists on using a lossy floating point type for numbers, which would be dangerous for monetary amounts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">asm</code> property of each scriptSig now contains the decoded signature hash type for each signature that provides a valid defined hash type.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>OP_NOP2 has been renamed to OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY by <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki\">BIP 65</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following items contain assembly representations of scriptSig signatures and are affected by this change:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>RPC <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getrawtransaction</code></li>\n<li>RPC <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">decoderawtransaction</code></li>\n<li>RPC <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">decodescript</code></li>\n<li>REST <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">/rest/tx/</code> (JSON format)</li>\n<li>REST <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">/rest/block/</code> (JSON format when including extended tx details)</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin-tx -json</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">scriptSig.asm</code> property of a transaction input that previously showed an assembly representation of:</p>\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>304502207fa7a6d1e0ee81132a269ad84e68d695483745cde8b541e3bf630749894e342a022100c1f7ab20e13e22fb95281a870f3dcf38d782e53023ee313d741ad0cfbc0c509001 400000 OP_NOP2\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>now shows as:</p>\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>304502207fa7a6d1e0ee81132a269ad84e68d695483745cde8b541e3bf630749894e342a022100c1f7ab20e13e22fb95281a870f3dcf38d782e53023ee313d741ad0cfbc0c5090[ALL] 400000 OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>Note that the output of the RPC <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">decodescript</code> did not change because it is configured specifically to process scriptPubKey and not scriptSig scripts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"rpc-ssl-support-dropped\">RPC: SSL support dropped</h2>\n<p>SSL support for RPC, previously enabled by the option <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">rpcssl</code> has been dropped from both the client and the server. This was done in preparation for removing the dependency on OpenSSL for the daemon completely.</p>\n<p>Trying to use <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">rpcssl</code> will result in an error:</p>\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>Error: SSL mode for RPC (-rpcssl) is no longer supported.\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>If you are one of the few people that relies on this feature, a flexible migration path is to use <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">stunnel</code>. This is an utility that can tunnel arbitrary TCP connections inside SSL. On e.g. Ubuntu it can be installed with:</p>\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>sudo apt-get install stunnel4\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>Then, to tunnel a SSL connection on 28332 to a RPC server bound on localhost on port 18332 do:</p>\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>stunnel -d 28332 -r 127.0.0.1:18332 -p stunnel.pem -P ''\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>It can also be set up system-wide in inetd style.</p>\n<p>Another way to re-attain SSL would be to setup a httpd reverse proxy. This solution would allow the use of different authentication, loadbalancing, on-the-fly compression and caching. A sample config for apache2 could look like:</p>\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>Listen 443\n\nNameVirtualHost *:443\n&lt;VirtualHost *:443&gt;\n\nSSLEngine On\nSSLCertificateFile /etc/apache2/ssl/server.crt\nSSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/apache2/ssl/server.key\n\n&lt;Location /bitcoinrpc&gt;\n    ProxyPass http://127.0.0.1:8332/\n    ProxyPassReverse http://127.0.0.1:8332/\n    # optional enable digest auth\n    # AuthType Digest\n    # ...\n\n    # optional bypass bitcoind rpc basic auth\n    # RequestHeader set Authorization \"Basic &lt;hash&gt;\"\n    # get the &lt;hash&gt; from the shell with: base64 &lt;&lt;&lt; bitcoinrpc:&lt;password&gt;\n&lt;/Location&gt;\n\n# Or, balance the load:\n# ProxyPass / balancer://balancer_cluster_name\n\n&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<h2 id=\"mining-code-changes\">Mining Code Changes</h2>\n<p>The mining code in 0.12 has been optimized to be significantly faster and use less memory. As part of these changes, consensus critical calculations are cached on a transaction\u00e2\u0080\u0099s acceptance into the mempool and the mining code now relies on the consistency of the mempool to assemble blocks. However all blocks are still tested for validity after assembly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"other-p2p-changes\">Other P2P Changes</h2>\n<p>The list of banned peers is now stored on disk rather than in memory. Restarting bitcoind will no longer clear out the list of banned peers; instead a new RPC call (<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">clearbanned</code>) can be used to manually clear the list.  The new <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">setban</code> RPC call can also be used to manually ban or unban a peer.</p>\n<h1 id=\"0120-change-log\">0.12.0 Change log</h1>\n<p>Detailed release notes follow.

It is\nrecommended to upgrade to this version as soon as possible.\nPlease report bugs using the issue tracker at github:\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues\nUpgrading and downgrading\nHow to Upgrade\nIf you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or\nbitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).\nDowngrade warning\nBecause release 0.10.0 and later makes use of headers-first synchronization and\nparallel block download (see further), the block files and databases are not\nbackwards-compatible with pre-0.10 versions of Bitcoin Core or other software:\n\n\nBlocks will be stored on disk out of order (in the order they are\nreceived, really), which makes it incompatible with some tools or\nother programs. Reindexing using earlier versions will also not work\nanymore as a result of this.\n\n\nThe block index database will now hold headers for which no block is\nstored on disk, which earlier versions won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t support.\n\n\nIf you want to be able to downgrade smoothly, make a backup of your entire data\ndirectory. Without this your node will need start syncing (or importing from\nbootstrap.dat) anew afterwards. It is possible that the data from a completely\nsynchronised 0.10 node may be usable in older versions as-is, but this is not\nsupported and may break as soon as the older version attempts to reindex.\nThis does not affect wallet forward or backward compatibility. There are no\nknown problems when downgrading from 0.11.x to 0.10.x.\nNotable changes since 0.11.1\nBIP65 soft fork to enforce OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY opcode\nThis release includes several changes related to the BIP65 soft fork\nwhich redefines the existing OP_NOP2 opcode as OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY\n(CLTV) so that a transaction output can be made unspendable until a\nspecified point in the future.\n\n\nThis release will only relay and mine transactions spending a CLTV\noutput if they comply with the BIP65 rules as provided in code.\n\n\nThis release will produce version 4 blocks by default. Please see the\nnotice to miners below.\n\n\nOnce 951 out of a sequence of 1,001 blocks on the local node\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best block\nchain contain version 4 (or higher) blocks, this release will no\nlonger accept new version 3 blocks and it will only accept version 4\nblocks if they comply with the BIP65 rules for CLTV.\n\n\nFor more information about the soft-forking change, please see\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6351\nGraphs showing the progress towards block version 4 adoption may be\nfound at the URLs below:\n\n\nBlock versions over the last 50,000 blocks as progress towards BIP65\nconsensus enforcement: http://bitcoin.sipa.be/ver-50k.png\n\n\nBlock versions over the last 2,000 blocks showing the days to the\nearliest possible BIP65 consensus-enforced block: http://bitcoin.sipa.be/ver-2k.png\n\n\nNotice to miners: Bitcoin Core\u00e2\u0080\u0099s block templates are now for\nversion 4 blocks only, and any mining software relying on its\ngetblocktemplate must be updated in parallel to use libblkmaker either\nversion 0.4.3 or any version from 0.5.2 onward.\n\n\nIf you are solo mining, this will affect you the moment you upgrade\nBitcoin Core, which must be done prior to BIP65 achieving its 951/1001\nstatus.\n\n\nIf you are mining with the stratum mining protocol: this does not\naffect you.\n\n\nIf you are mining with the getblocktemplate protocol to a pool: this\nwill affect you at the pool operator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s discretion, which must be no\nlater than BIP65 achieving its 951/1001 status.\n\n\nBIP113 mempool-only locktime enforcement using GetMedianTimePast()\nBitcoin transactions currently may specify a locktime indicating when\nthey may be added to a valid block.  Current consensus rules require\nthat blocks have a block header time greater than the locktime specified\nin any transaction in that block.\nMiners get to choose what time they use for their header time, with the\nconsensus rule being that no node will accept a block whose time is more\nthan two hours in the future.  This creates a incentive for miners to\nset their header times to future values in order to include locktimed\ntransactions which weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t supposed to be included for up to two more\nhours.\nThe consensus rules also specify that valid blocks may have a header\ntime greater than that of the median of the 11 previous blocks.  This\nGetMedianTimePast() time has a key feature we generally associate with\ntime: it can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go backwards.\nBIP113 specifies a soft fork (not enforced in this release) that\nweakens this perverse incentive for individual miners to use a future\ntime by requiring that valid blocks have a computed GetMedianTimePast()\ngreater than the locktime specified in any transaction in that block.\nMempool inclusion rules currently require transactions to be valid for\nimmediate inclusion in a block in order to be accepted into the mempool.\nThis release begins applying the BIP113 rule to received transactions,\nso transaction whose time is greater than the GetMedianTimePast() will\nno longer be accepted into the mempool.\nImplication for miners: you will begin rejecting transactions that\nwould not be valid under BIP113, which will prevent you from producing\ninvalid blocks if/when BIP113 is enforced on the network. Any\ntransactions which are valid under the current rules but not yet valid\nunder the BIP113 rules will either be mined by other miners or delayed\nuntil they are valid under BIP113. Note, however, that time-based\nlocktime transactions are more or less unseen on the network currently.\nImplication for users: GetMedianTimePast() always trails behind the\ncurrent time, so a transaction locktime set to the present time will be\nrejected by nodes running this release until the median time moves\nforward. To compensate, subtract one hour (3,600 seconds) from your\nlocktimes to allow those transactions to be included in mempools at\napproximately the expected time.\nWindows bug fix for corrupted UTXO database on unclean shutdowns\nSeveral Windows users reported that they often need to reindex the\nentire blockchain after an unclean shutdown of Bitcoin Core on Windows\n(or an unclean shutdown of Windows itself). Although unclean shutdowns\nremain unsafe, this release no longer relies on memory-mapped files for\nthe UTXO database, which significantly reduced the frequency of unclean\nshutdowns leading to required reindexes during testing.\nFor more information, see: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6917\nOther fixes for database corruption on Windows are expected in the\nnext major release.\n0.11.2 Change log\nDetailed release notes follow.

Please see the\n<em>notice to miners</em> below.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Once 951 out of a sequence of 1,001 blocks on the local node\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best block\nchain contain version 4 (or higher) blocks, this release will no\nlonger accept new version 3 blocks and it will only accept version 4\nblocks if they comply with the BIP65 rules for CLTV.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For more information about the soft-forking change, please see\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6351\">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6351</a></p>\n<p>Graphs showing the progress towards block version 4 adoption may be\nfound at the URLs below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Block versions over the last 50,000 blocks as progress towards BIP65\nconsensus enforcement: <a href=\"http://bitcoin.sipa.be/ver-50k.png\">http://bitcoin.sipa.be/ver-50k.png</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Block versions over the last 2,000 blocks showing the days to the\nearliest possible BIP65 consensus-enforced block: <a href=\"http://bitcoin.sipa.be/ver-2k.png\">http://bitcoin.sipa.be/ver-2k.png</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Notice to miners:</strong> Bitcoin Core\u00e2\u0080\u0099s block templates are now for\nversion 4 blocks only, and any mining software relying on its\ngetblocktemplate must be updated in parallel to use libblkmaker either\nversion 0.4.3 or any version from 0.5.2 onward.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If you are solo mining, this will affect you the moment you upgrade\nBitcoin Core, which must be done prior to BIP65 achieving its 951/1001\nstatus.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you are mining with the stratum mining protocol: this does not\naffect you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you are mining with the getblocktemplate protocol to a pool: this\nwill affect you at the pool operator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s discretion, which must be no\nlater than BIP65 achieving its 951/1001 status.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"bip113-mempool-only-locktime-enforcement-using-getmediantimepast\">BIP113 mempool-only locktime enforcement using GetMedianTimePast()</h2>\n<p>Bitcoin transactions currently may specify a locktime indicating when\nthey may be added to a valid block.  Current consensus rules require\nthat blocks have a block header time greater than the locktime specified\nin any transaction in that block.</p>\n<p>Miners get to choose what time they use for their header time, with the\nconsensus rule being that no node will accept a block whose time is more\nthan two hours in the future.  This creates a incentive for miners to\nset their header times to future values in order to include locktimed\ntransactions which weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t supposed to be included for up to two more\nhours.</p>\n<p>The consensus rules also specify that valid blocks may have a header\ntime greater than that of the median of the 11 previous blocks.  This\nGetMedianTimePast() time has a key feature we generally associate with\ntime: it can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go backwards.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0113.mediawiki\">BIP113</a> specifies a soft fork (<strong>not enforced in this release</strong>) that\nweakens this perverse incentive for individual miners to use a future\ntime by requiring that valid blocks have a computed GetMedianTimePast()\ngreater than the locktime specified in any transaction in that block.</p>\n<p>Mempool inclusion rules currently require transactions to be valid for\nimmediate inclusion in a block in order to be accepted into the mempool.\nThis release begins applying the BIP113 rule to received transactions,\nso transaction whose time is greater than the GetMedianTimePast() will\nno longer be accepted into the mempool.</p>\n<p><strong>Implication for miners:</strong> you will begin rejecting transactions that\nwould not be valid under BIP113, which will prevent you from producing\ninvalid blocks if/when BIP113 is enforced on the network. Any\ntransactions which are valid under the current rules but not yet valid\nunder the BIP113 rules will either be mined by other miners or delayed\nuntil they are valid under BIP113. Note, however, that time-based\nlocktime transactions are more or less unseen on the network currently.</p>\n<p><strong>Implication for users:</strong> GetMedianTimePast() always trails behind the\ncurrent time, so a transaction locktime set to the present time will be\nrejected by nodes running this release until the median time moves\nforward. To compensate, subtract one hour (3,600 seconds) from your\nlocktimes to allow those transactions to be included in mempools at\napproximately the expected time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"windows-bug-fix-for-corrupted-utxo-database-on-unclean-shutdowns\">Windows bug fix for corrupted UTXO database on unclean shutdowns</h2>\n<p>Several Windows users reported that they often need to reindex the\nentire blockchain after an unclean shutdown of Bitcoin Core on Windows\n(or an unclean shutdown of Windows itself). Although unclean shutdowns\nremain unsafe, this release no longer relies on memory-mapped files for\nthe UTXO database, which significantly reduced the frequency of unclean\nshutdowns leading to required reindexes during testing.</p>\n<p>For more information, see: <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6917\">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6917</a></p>\n<p>Other fixes for database corruption on Windows are expected in the\nnext major release.</p>\n<h1 id=\"0112-change-log\">0.11.2 Change log</h1>\n<p>Detailed release notes follow.

It is recommended\nto upgrade to this version as soon as possible.\nPlease report bugs using the issue tracker at github:\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues\nUpgrading and downgrading\nHow to Upgrade\nIf you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or\nbitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).\nDowngrade warning\nBecause release 0.10.0 and later makes use of headers-first synchronization and\nparallel block download (see further), the block files and databases are not\nbackwards-compatible with pre-0.10 versions of Bitcoin Core or other software:\n\n\nBlocks will be stored on disk out of order (in the order they are\nreceived, really), which makes it incompatible with some tools or\nother programs.

It is possible that the data from a completely\nsynchronised 0.10 node may be usable in older versions as-is, but this is not\nsupported and may break as soon as the older version attempts to reindex.\nThis does not affect wallet forward or backward compatibility. There are no\nknown problems when downgrading from 0.11.x to 0.10.x.\nNotable changes\nFix buffer overflow in bundled upnp\nBundled miniupnpc was updated to 1.9.20151008. This fixes a buffer overflow in\nthe XML parser during initial network discovery.\nDetails can be found here: http://talosintel.com/reports/TALOS-2015-0035/\nThis applies to the distributed executables only, not when building from source or\nusing distribution provided packages.\nAdditionally, upnp has been disabled by default. This may result in a lower\nnumber of reachable nodes on IPv4, however this prevents future libupnpc\nvulnerabilities from being a structural risk to the network\n(see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6795).\nTest for LowS signatures before relaying\nMake the node require the canonical \u00e2\u0080\u0098low-s\u00e2\u0080\u0099 encoding for ECDSA signatures when\nrelaying or mining.  This removes a nuisance malleability vector.\nConsensus behavior is unchanged.\nIf widely deployed this change would eliminate the last remaining known vector\nfor nuisance malleability on SIGHASH_ALL P2PKH transactions. On the down-side\nit will block most transactions made by sufficiently out of date software.\nUnlike the other avenues to change txids on transactions this\none was randomly violated by all deployed bitcoin software prior to\nits discovery. So, while other malleability vectors where made\nnon-standard as soon as they were discovered, this one has remained\npermitted. Even BIP62 did not propose applying this rule to\nold version transactions, but conforming implementations have become\nmuch more common since BIP62 was initially written.\nBitcoin Core has produced compatible signatures since a28fb70e in\nSeptember 2013, but this didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make it into a release until 0.9\nin March 2014; Bitcoinj has done so for a similar span of time.\nBitcoinjs and electrum have been more recently updated.\nThis does not replace the need for BIP62 or similar, as miners can\nstill cooperate to break transactions.  Nor does it replace the\nneed for wallet software to handle malleability sanely[1]. This\nonly eliminates the cheap and irritating DOS attack.\n[1] On the Malleability of Bitcoin Transactions\nMarcin Andrychowicz, Stefan Dziembowski, Daniel Malinowski, \u00c5\u0081ukasz Mazurek\nhttp://fc15.ifca.ai/preproceedings/bitcoin/paper_9.pdf\nMinimum relay fee default increase\nThe default for the -minrelaytxfee setting has been increased from 0.00001\nto 0.00005.\nThis is necessitated by the current transaction flooding, causing\noutrageous memory usage on nodes due to the mempool ballooning.

Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or\nbitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).</p>\n<h2 id=\"downgrade-warning\">Downgrade warning</h2>\n<p>Because release 0.10.0 and later makes use of headers-first synchronization and\nparallel block download (see further), the block files and databases are not\nbackwards-compatible with pre-0.10 versions of Bitcoin Core or other software:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Blocks will be stored on disk out of order (in the order they are\nreceived, really), which makes it incompatible with some tools or\nother programs. Reindexing using earlier versions will also not work\nanymore as a result of this.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The block index database will now hold headers for which no block is\nstored on disk, which earlier versions won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t support.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want to be able to downgrade smoothly, make a backup of your entire data\ndirectory. Without this your node will need start syncing (or importing from\nbootstrap.dat) anew afterwards. It is possible that the data from a completely\nsynchronised 0.10 node may be usable in older versions as-is, but this is not\nsupported and may break as soon as the older version attempts to reindex.</p>\n<p>This does not affect wallet forward or backward compatibility. There are no\nknown problems when downgrading from 0.11.x to 0.10.x.</p>\n<h1 id=\"notable-changes\">Notable changes</h1>\n<h2 id=\"fix-buffer-overflow-in-bundled-upnp\">Fix buffer overflow in bundled upnp</h2>\n<p>Bundled miniupnpc was updated to 1.9.20151008.

Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or\nbitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).\nDowngrade warning\nBecause release 0.10.0 and later makes use of headers-first synchronization and\nparallel block download (see further), the block files and databases are not\nbackwards-compatible with pre-0.10 versions of Bitcoin Core or other software:\n\n\nBlocks will be stored on disk out of order (in the order they are\nreceived, really), which makes it incompatible with some tools or\nother programs. Reindexing using earlier versions will also not work\nanymore as a result of this.\n\n\nThe block index database will now hold headers for which no block is\nstored on disk, which earlier versions won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t support.\n\n\nIf you want to be able to downgrade smoothly, make a backup of your entire data\ndirectory. Without this your node will need start syncing (or importing from\nbootstrap.dat) anew afterwards. It is possible that the data from a completely\nsynchronised 0.10 node may be usable in older versions as-is, but this is not\nsupported and may break as soon as the older version attempts to reindex.\nThis does not affect wallet forward or backward compatibility. There are no\nknown problems when downgrading from 0.11.x to 0.10.x.\nImportant information\nTransaction flooding\nAt the time of this release, the P2P network is being flooded with low-fee\ntransactions. This causes a ballooning of the mempool size.\nIf this growth of the mempool causes problematic memory use on your node, it is\npossible to change a few configuration options to work around this. The growth\nof the mempool can be monitored with the RPC command getmempoolinfo.\nOne is to increase the minimum transaction relay fee minrelaytxfee, which\ndefaults to 0.00001. This will cause transactions with fewer BTC/kB fee to be\nrejected, and thus fewer transactions entering the mempool.\nThe other is to restrict the relaying of free transactions with\nlimitfreerelay. This option sets the number of kB/minute at which\nfree transactions (with enough priority) will be accepted. It defaults to 15.\nReducing this number reduces the speed at which the mempool can grow due\nto free transactions.\nFor example, add the following to bitcoin.conf:\nminrelaytxfee=0.00005\nlimitfreerelay=5\n\nMore robust solutions are being worked on for a follow-up release.\nNotable changes\nBlock file pruning\nThis release supports running a fully validating node without maintaining a copy\nof the raw block and undo data on disk. To recap, there are four types of data\nrelated to the blockchain in the bitcoin system: the raw blocks as received over\nthe network (blk???.dat), the undo data (rev???.dat), the block index and the\nUTXO set (both LevelDB databases). The databases are built from the raw data.\nBlock pruning allows Bitcoin Core to delete the raw block and undo data once\nit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been validated and used to build the databases. At that point, the raw data\nis used only to relay blocks to other nodes, to handle reorganizations, to look\nup old transactions (if -txindex is enabled or via the RPC/REST interfaces), or\nfor rescanning the wallet. The block index continues to hold the metadata about\nall blocks in the blockchain.\nThe user specifies how much space to allot for block & undo files. The minimum\nallowed is 550MB. Note that this is in addition to whatever is required for the\nblock index and UTXO databases. The minimum was chosen so that Bitcoin Core will\nbe able to maintain at least 288 blocks on disk (two days worth of blocks at 10\nminutes per block). In rare instances it is possible that the amount of space\nused will exceed the pruning target in order to keep the required last 288\nblocks on disk.\nBlock pruning works during initial sync in the same way as during steady state,\nby deleting block files \u00e2\u0080\u009cas you go\u00e2\u0080\u009d whenever disk space is allocated. Thus, if\nthe user specifies 550MB, once that level is reached the program will begin\ndeleting the oldest block and undo files, while continuing to download the\nblockchain.\nFor now, block pruning disables block relay.  In the future, nodes with block\npruning will at a minimum relay \u00e2\u0080\u009cnew\u00e2\u0080\u009d blocks, meaning blocks that extend their\nactive chain.\nBlock pruning is currently incompatible with running a wallet due to the fact\nthat block data is used for rescanning the wallet and importing keys or\naddresses (which require a rescan.) However, running the wallet with block\npruning will be supported in the near future, subject to those limitations.\nBlock pruning is also incompatible with -txindex and will automatically disable\nit.\nOnce you have pruned blocks, going back to unpruned state requires\nre-downloading the entire blockchain. To do this, re-start the node with\n-reindex. Note also that any problem that would cause a user to reindex (e.g.,\ndisk corruption) will cause a pruned node to redownload the entire blockchain.\nFinally, note that when a pruned node reindexes, it will delete any blk???.dat\nand rev???.dat files in the data directory prior to restarting the download.\nTo enable block pruning on the command line:\n\n-prune=N: where N is the number of MB to allot for raw block & undo data.\n\nModified RPC calls:\n\ngetblockchaininfo now includes whether we are in pruned mode or not.\ngetblock will check if the block\u00e2\u0080\u0099s data has been pruned and if so, return an\nerror.\ngetrawtransaction will no longer be able to locate a transaction that has a\nUTXO but where its block file has been pruned.\n\nPruning is disabled by default.\nBig endian support\nExperimental support for big-endian CPU architectures was added in this\nrelease. All little-endian specific code was replaced with endian-neutral\nconstructs. This has been tested on at least MIPS and PPC hosts. The build\nsystem will automatically detect the endianness of the target.\nMemory usage optimization\nThere have been many changes in this release to reduce the default memory usage\nof a node, among which:\n\nAccurate UTXO cache size accounting (#6102); this makes the option -dbcache\nprecise where this grossly underestimated memory usage before\nReduce size of per-peer data structure (#6064 and others); this increases the\nnumber of connections that can be supported with the same amount of memory\nReduce the number of threads (#5964, #5679); lowers the amount of (esp.\nvirtual) memory needed\n\nFee estimation changes\nThis release improves the algorithm used for fee estimation.  Previously, -1\nwas returned when there was insufficient data to give an estimate.  Now, -1\nwill also be returned when there is no fee or priority high enough for the\ndesired confirmation target. In those cases, it can help to ask for an estimate\nfor a higher target number of blocks. It is not uncommon for there to be no\nfee or priority high enough to be reliably (85%) included in the next block and\nfor this reason, the default for -txconfirmtarget=n has changed from 1 to 2.\nPrivacy: Disable wallet transaction broadcast\nThis release adds an option -walletbroadcast=0 to prevent automatic\ntransaction broadcast and rebroadcast (#5951). This option allows separating\ntransaction submission from the node functionality.\nMaking use of this, third-party scripts can be written to take care of\ntransaction (re)broadcast:\n\nSend the transaction as normal, either through RPC or the GUI\nRetrieve the transaction data through RPC using gettransaction (NOT\ngetrawtransaction). The hex field of the result will contain the raw\nhexadecimal representation of the transaction\nThe transaction can then be broadcasted through arbitrary mechanisms\nsupported by the script\n\nOne such application is selective Tor usage, where the node runs on the normal\ninternet but transactions are broadcasted over Tor.\nFor an example script see bitcoin-submittx.\nPrivacy: Stream isolation for Tor\nThis release adds functionality to create a new circuit for every peer\nconnection, when the software is used with Tor. The new option,\n-proxyrandomize, is on by default.\nWhen enabled, every outgoing connection will (potentially) go through a\ndifferent exit node. That significantly reduces the chance to get unlucky and\npick a single exit node that is either malicious, or widely banned from the P2P\nnetwork. This improves connection reliability as well as privacy, especially\nfor the initial connections.\nImportant note: If a non-Tor SOCKS5 proxy is configured that supports\nauthentication, but doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t require it, this change may cause that proxy to reject\nconnections. A user and password is sent where they weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t before. This setup\nis exceedingly rare, but in this case -proxyrandomize=0 can be passed to\ndisable the behavior.\n0.11.0 Change log\nDetailed release notes follow.

Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or\nbitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).</p>\n<h2 id=\"downgrade-warning\">Downgrade warning</h2>\n<p>Because release 0.10.0 and later makes use of headers-first synchronization and\nparallel block download (see further), the block files and databases are not\nbackwards-compatible with pre-0.10 versions of Bitcoin Core or other software:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Blocks will be stored on disk out of order (in the order they are\nreceived, really), which makes it incompatible with some tools or\nother programs. Reindexing using earlier versions will also not work\nanymore as a result of this.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The block index database will now hold headers for which no block is\nstored on disk, which earlier versions won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t support.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want to be able to downgrade smoothly, make a backup of your entire data\ndirectory. Without this your node will need start syncing (or importing from\nbootstrap.dat) anew afterwards. It is possible that the data from a completely\nsynchronised 0.10 node may be usable in older versions as-is, but this is not\nsupported and may break as soon as the older version attempts to reindex.</p>\n<p>This does not affect wallet forward or backward compatibility. There are no\nknown problems when downgrading from 0.11.x to 0.10.x.</p>\n<h1 id=\"important-information\">Important information</h1>\n<h2 id=\"transaction-flooding\">Transaction flooding</h2>\n<p>At the time of this release, the P2P network is being flooded with low-fee\ntransactions. This causes a ballooning of the mempool size.</p>\n<p>If this growth of the mempool causes problematic memory use on your node, it is\npossible to change a few configuration options to work around this. The growth\nof the mempool can be monitored with the RPC command <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getmempoolinfo</code>.</p>\n<p>One is to increase the minimum transaction relay fee <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">minrelaytxfee</code>, which\ndefaults to 0.00001. This will cause transactions with fewer BTC/kB fee to be\nrejected, and thus fewer transactions entering the mempool.</p>\n<p>The other is to restrict the relaying of free transactions with\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">limitfreerelay</code>. This option sets the number of kB/minute at which\nfree transactions (with enough priority) will be accepted. It defaults to 15.\nReducing this number reduces the speed at which the mempool can grow due\nto free transactions.</p>\n<p>For example, add the following to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bitcoin.conf</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>minrelaytxfee=0.00005\nlimitfreerelay=5\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>More robust solutions are being worked on for a follow-up release.</p>\n<h1 id=\"notable-changes\">Notable changes</h1>\n<h2 id=\"block-file-pruning\">Block file pruning</h2>\n<p>This release supports running a fully validating node without maintaining a copy\nof the raw block and undo data on disk. To recap, there are four types of data\nrelated to the blockchain in the bitcoin system: the raw blocks as received over\nthe network (blk???.dat), the undo data (rev???.dat), the block index and the\nUTXO set (both LevelDB databases). The databases are built from the raw data.</p>\n<p>Block pruning allows Bitcoin Core to delete the raw block and undo data once\nit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been validated and used to build the databases. At that point, the raw data\nis used only to relay blocks to other nodes, to handle reorganizations, to look\nup old transactions (if -txindex is enabled or via the RPC/REST interfaces), or\nfor rescanning the wallet. The block index continues to hold the metadata about\nall blocks in the blockchain.</p>\n<p>The user specifies how much space to allot for block &amp; undo files. The minimum\nallowed is 550MB. Note that this is in addition to whatever is required for the\nblock index and UTXO databases. The minimum was chosen so that Bitcoin Core will\nbe able to maintain at least 288 blocks on disk (two days worth of blocks at 10\nminutes per block). In rare instances it is possible that the amount of space\nused will exceed the pruning target in order to keep the required last 288\nblocks on disk.</p>\n<p>Block pruning works during initial sync in the same way as during steady state,\nby deleting block files \u00e2\u0080\u009cas you go\u00e2\u0080\u009d whenever disk space is allocated. Thus, if\nthe user specifies 550MB, once that level is reached the program will begin\ndeleting the oldest block and undo files, while continuing to download the\nblockchain.</p>\n<p>For now, block pruning disables block relay.  In the future, nodes with block\npruning will at a minimum relay \u00e2\u0080\u009cnew\u00e2\u0080\u009d blocks, meaning blocks that extend their\nactive chain.</p>\n<p>Block pruning is currently incompatible with running a wallet due to the fact\nthat block data is used for rescanning the wallet and importing keys or\naddresses (which require a rescan.) However, running the wallet with block\npruning will be supported in the near future, subject to those limitations.</p>\n<p>Block pruning is also incompatible with -txindex and will automatically disable\nit.</p>\n<p>Once you have pruned blocks, going back to unpruned state requires\nre-downloading the entire blockchain. To do this, re-start the node with\n-reindex. Note also that any problem that would cause a user to reindex (e.g.,\ndisk corruption) will cause a pruned node to redownload the entire blockchain.\nFinally, note that when a pruned node reindexes, it will delete any blk???.dat\nand rev???.dat files in the data directory prior to restarting the download.</p>\n<p>To enable block pruning on the command line:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-prune=N</code>: where N is the number of MB to allot for raw block &amp; undo data.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Modified RPC calls:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getblockchaininfo</code> now includes whether we are in pruned mode or not.</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getblock</code> will check if the block\u00e2\u0080\u0099s data has been pruned and if so, return an\nerror.</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getrawtransaction</code> will no longer be able to locate a transaction that has a\nUTXO but where its block file has been pruned.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Pruning is disabled by default.</p>\n<h2 id=\"big-endian-support\">Big endian support</h2>\n<p>Experimental support for big-endian CPU architectures was added in this\nrelease. All little-endian specific code was replaced with endian-neutral\nconstructs. This has been tested on at least MIPS and PPC hosts. The build\nsystem will automatically detect the endianness of the target.</p>\n<h2 id=\"memory-usage-optimization\">Memory usage optimization</h2>\n<p>There have been many changes in this release to reduce the default memory usage\nof a node, among which:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Accurate UTXO cache size accounting (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6102\">#6102</a>); this makes the option <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-dbcache</code>\nprecise where this grossly underestimated memory usage before</li>\n<li>Reduce size of per-peer data structure (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6064\">#6064</a> and others); this increases the\nnumber of connections that can be supported with the same amount of memory</li>\n<li>Reduce the number of threads (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5964\">#5964</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5679\">#5679</a>); lowers the amount of (esp.\nvirtual) memory needed</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"fee-estimation-changes\">Fee estimation changes</h2>\n<p>This release improves the algorithm used for fee estimation.  Previously, -1\nwas returned when there was insufficient data to give an estimate.  Now, -1\nwill also be returned when there is no fee or priority high enough for the\ndesired confirmation target. In those cases, it can help to ask for an estimate\nfor a higher target number of blocks. It is not uncommon for there to be no\nfee or priority high enough to be reliably (85%) included in the next block and\nfor this reason, the default for <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-txconfirmtarget=n</code> has changed from 1 to 2.</p>\n<h2 id=\"privacy-disable-wallet-transaction-broadcast\">Privacy: Disable wallet transaction broadcast</h2>\n<p>This release adds an option <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-walletbroadcast=0</code> to prevent automatic\ntransaction broadcast and rebroadcast (<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5951\">#5951</a>). This option allows separating\ntransaction submission from the node functionality.</p>\n<p>Making use of this, third-party scripts can be written to take care of\ntransaction (re)broadcast:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Send the transaction as normal, either through RPC or the GUI</li>\n<li>Retrieve the transaction data through RPC using <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">gettransaction</code> (NOT\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">getrawtransaction</code>). The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">hex</code> field of the result will contain the raw\nhexadecimal representation of the transaction</li>\n<li>The transaction can then be broadcasted through arbitrary mechanisms\nsupported by the script</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One such application is selective Tor usage, where the node runs on the normal\ninternet but transactions are broadcasted over Tor.</p>\n<p>For an example script see <a href=\"https://github.com/laanwj/bitcoin-submittx\">bitcoin-submittx</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"privacy-stream-isolation-for-tor\">Privacy: Stream isolation for Tor</h2>\n<p>This release adds functionality to create a new circuit for every peer\nconnection, when the software is used with Tor. The new option,\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-proxyrandomize</code>, is on by default.</p>\n<p>When enabled, every outgoing connection will (potentially) go through a\ndifferent exit node. That significantly reduces the chance to get unlucky and\npick a single exit node that is either malicious, or widely banned from the P2P\nnetwork. This improves connection reliability as well as privacy, especially\nfor the initial connections.</p>\n<p><strong>Important note:</strong> If a non-Tor SOCKS5 proxy is configured that supports\nauthentication, but doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t require it, this change may cause that proxy to reject\nconnections. A user and password is sent where they weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t before. This setup\nis exceedingly rare, but in this case <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-proxyrandomize=0</code> can be passed to\ndisable the behavior.</p>\n<h1 id=\"0110-change-log\">0.11.0 Change log</h1>\n<p>Detailed release notes follow.
