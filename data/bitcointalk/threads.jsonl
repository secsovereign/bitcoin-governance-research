Plenty of discussion already existis, but now, on a specific matter, a BIPhttps://x.com/ostrom72158/status/1997537240701112497https://github.com/ostromcode/The-CatI am for it.Rationale:RationaleThis BIP makes minimal changes to the consensus surface. It adds no new opcodes and does not expand Bitcoin\u0092s scripting language or programmability. Instead, it introduces a single new consensus concept: a binary classification that marks some existing UTXOs as permanently unspendable Non-Monetary UTXOs (NMUs). In that sense, it is closer to a one-time reclassification of a subset of UTXOs than an ongoing change to Bitcoin\u0092s programming model.External indexers, determinism, and reproducibilityInstead of re-implementing complex inscription and stamp classification rules in Bitcoin clients, this BIP relies on mature tools that are already used by the non-monetary data community, specifically Ord and Stamps. Exact versions of these indexers are specified and pinned by commit so that their behavior is deterministic. The NMU set is defined in terms of chain data as seen through these specified indexers, rather than as an arbitrary hard-coded list of UTXOs. This keeps the consensus rule grounded in chain-derived information while avoiding the need to embed inscription logic directly in Bitcoin client software.", "date": "Hero Member\n\n Offline\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tActivity: 1302\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMerit: 682\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI rather die on my feet than to live on my knees", "thread_url": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5568016.0", "source": "bitcointalk"}

And so with each word, one at a time, some change the case and layout, others do not. And so on, in the order of all the words. As a result, the entire set of passwords was saved to a file(s) for further selection.", "date": "Newbie\n\n Offline\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tActivity: 1\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMerit: 0", "thread_url": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5567449.0", "source": "bitcointalk"}
{"forum": "bitcointalk", "board": "Development & Technical Discussion", "author": "Rapten", "content": "Okay, how do I even begin, it all started about two months ago when I came across a crypto scam wallet that is connected to a pigbutchering scam that had hundreds of thousands of transactions and I thought wow that seems odd to me there has to be some sort of vulnerability in this wallet that could help rescue these victims from. So I start poking around and it appears that some of its earliest transactions exhibit GCD bias of about 39% back when the random generator for signature was using prng before RFC 6797 was implemented there is a window of about 3000 signatures in this wallet that are all bias'd however besides reuse and several failed lattice attempts later I've hit a brick wall on attempting to break the key for the wallet to try to release all the funds from all the people this wallet has scammed. Its automated runs batched transactions produces thousands of transactions daily and appears to have fixed its initial prng state which is why anyone that pulled up all the transactions for it and tried to build a lattice for the wallet would straight up fail it's been diluted from better rng as time has gone on. For grins I started poking around a few other wallets with a similar mo thousands or hundreds of transactions per day gcd bias in their implementation initially that smooths out over time. I would really love if anyone who understands this stuff and is interested and willing to help me recover the funds for this wallet. we are talking massive money in the neighborhood of hundreds of millions of dollars in these wallets that I truly would love to set back to their original owners. Anyway if anyone understands how the python scep256 libraries changed during 2022 to around July 2022 and has the technical expertise on how to crack this sort of implementation and wants a project I'm sure it would end up with a sizable reward I'm more than willing to share all the knowledge I have on the situation and would love to get an expert opinion on how this stuff works. I set up sage math and have fpylll installed along with all the other dependencies but just honestly don't have a complete grasp how to get this past the finish line. If anyone wants to help I'm sure if we crack this anything any of the victims get back would be a win for them.", "date": "Newbie\n\n Offline\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tActivity: 1\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMerit: 0", "thread_url": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5565390.0", "source": "bitcointalk"}

Which becomes quite complicated if we handle dozens and dozens of addresses, and we reuse some of them (like giveaways, campaigns, and other recurring payments, etc). I know there is a privacy risk about address reuse, but that is manageable if you handle UTXO with patience. The security is what bugs me now.Until when do you guys think it is safe to keep reusing addresses like? I was thinking about creating a new wallet and sending all coins to a newly wallet, because my current wallet has like 50+ used addresses and change addresses with most of them already spent from... And I also use a Hardware wallet, which makes things a little slower to handle.How do you guys manage so much addresses?
