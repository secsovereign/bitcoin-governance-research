# Cross-Repository Comparison Report

**Analysis Date**: 2026-01-18  
**Data Sources**: Bitcoin Core repository, BIPs repository  
**Purpose**: Compare governance patterns between Core and BIPs repositories

---

## Overview

This report compares governance patterns between Bitcoin Core and BIPs repositories, examining actor overlap, power portability, and process differences.

---

## Key Findings

### 1. Actor Overlap

**Core Authors**: 2,409  
**BIP Authors**: 684  
**Overlapping Authors**: 272 (11.3% of Core authors)

### 2. Governance Pattern Comparison

**Core Repository**:
- Top 3 Share: 0.3%
- Gini Coefficient: 0.614

**BIPs Repository**:
- Top 3 Share: 11.1%
- Gini Coefficient: 0.554

---

## Implications

1. **Overlap Rate**: 11.3% overlap suggests BIPs process is distinct from Core governance
2. **Concentration Difference**: BIPs top3 share (11.1%) vs Core (0.3%) indicates different power distribution
